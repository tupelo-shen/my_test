naming convention

1 naming identifiers

1.1 First, it is a convention in C++ that variable names should begin with a lower-case letter.If the variable name is one word, the whole thing should be written in lower-case letters.
	int value;	// correct
	int Value;	// incorrect(should start with lower case letter)
	int VALUE;	// incorrect
	int ValuE;	// incorrect

1.2 Identifier names that start with a capital letter are typically used for structs, classes, and enumerations.

1.3 Functions are also started with a lower-case letter.If the  variable or function name is multi-word, intercapped(sometimes called CamelCase, since he capital letters stick up like the humps on a camel).
	int myVariableName;	// correct(intercapped/CamelCase)
	int myFunctionName;	// correct(intercapped/CamelCase)
	int MyVariableName;	// valid but incorrect(should start with lower-case letter)
	int MyFunctionName;	// valid but not best practice
