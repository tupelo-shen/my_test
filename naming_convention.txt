naming convention

1 naming identifiers

1.1 First, it is a convention in C++ that variable names should begin with a lower-case letter.If the variable name is one word, the whole thing should be written in lower-case letters.
	int value;	// correct
	int Value;	// incorrect(should start with lower case letter)
	int VALUE;	// incorrect
	int ValuE;	// incorrect

1.2 Identifier names that start with a capital letter are typically used for structs, classes, and enumerations.

1.3 Functions are also started with a lower-case letter.If the  variable or function name is multi-word, intercapped(sometimes called CamelCase, since he capital letters stick up like the humps on a camel).
	int myVariableName;	// correct(intercapped/CamelCase)
	int myFunctionName;	// correct(intercapped/CamelCase)
	int MyVariableName;	// valid but incorrect(should start with lower-case letter)
	int MyFunctionName;	// valid but not best practice

2 Basic Formatting

2.1 The tabs should be set to 4 spaces.The reason to use spaces instead of tab characters is so that if you open your code in another viewer, it'll retain the correct indentation.

2.2 The braces that tell where a function begins and ends should be aligned with the function name, and be on their own lines.

for example:
int main()
{
}

2.3 Each statement within braces should start one tab in from the opening brace of the function it belongs to.

for example:
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;	// tabbed in one tab(4 spaces)
}

2.4 Lines should not be too long.

2.5 If a long line that is broken into piece is broken with an operator(eg. << or +),the operator should be placed at the end of the line, not the start of the next line:

for example:
std::cout << "This is a really,really,really,really,really,really," <<
	"really long line" << std::endl;
NOT
std::cout << "This is a really,really,really,really,really,really,"
	<< "really long line" << std::endl;

2.6 Use whitespace to make your code easier to read.
Harder to read:
	nCost = 57;
	nPricePerItem = 24;
	nValue = 5;
	nNumberOfItems = 17;
Easier to read:
	nCost		= 57;
	nPricePerItem	= 24;
	nValue		= 5;
	nNumberOfItems	= 17;

3 Headers
3.1 Rule1: Use angled brackets to include header files that come with the compilUse double quotes to include any other header files.
3.2 Rule2: Each .cpp file should explicitly #include all of the header files it needs to compile.
3.3 Rule3: Use the non .h version of a library if it exists, and access the functionality through the std namespace. If the non .h version does not exist, or you are creation your own headers, use the .h version.
