In order to thoroughly  understand what makes Linux tick and why it works so well on a wide variety of systems, you need to delve deep into the heart of the kernel. The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, and in what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can share the system efficiently. It expertly organizes data transfers so that the CPU isn't kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow hard disks.

*Understanding the Linux Kernel*, Third Edition, takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights for those who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings [[support with evidence or authority or make more certain or confirm]]() of why Linux does things the way it does.

The third edition of the book covers version 2.6, which has seen signigican changes to nearly every kernel subsystem. particularly in the areas of memory management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics:

* Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct Memory Access(DMA)
* The virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended Filesystem
* Process creation and scheduling
* Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers
* Timing
* Synchronization within the kernel
* Interprocess Communication(IPC)
* Program execution

*Understanding the Linux kernel* will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but it's more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. This book will help you make the most of your Linux system.

<h1 id="1">1 简介</h1>

Linux is a member of the large family of Unix-like operating systems. A relative newcomer experiencing sudden spectacular[[*惊人的*]]() popularity starting in the late 1990s, Linux joins such well-known commercial Unix operating systems as System V Release 4(SVR4), developed by AT&T (now owned by the SCO Group); the 4.4 BSD release from the University of California at Berkeley (4.4BSD); Digital UNIX from Digital Equipment Corporation (now Hewlett-Packard); AIX from IBM; HP-UX from Hewlett-Packard; Solaris from Sun Microsystems; and Mac OS X from Apple Computer, Inc. Beside Linux, a few other opensource Unix-like kernels exist, such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

Linux was initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as an operating system for IBM-compatible personal computers based on the Intel 80386 microprocessor. Linus remains deeply involved with improving Linux, keeping it up-to-date with various hardware developments and coordinating the activity of hundreds of Linux developers around the world. Over the years, developers have worked to make Linux available on other architectures, including Hewlett-Packard’s Alpha, Intel’s Itanium, AMD’s AMD64, PowerPC, and IBM’s zSeries.

One of the more appealing benefits to Linux is that it isn’t a commercial operating system: its source code under the *GNU General Public License (GPL)† *is open and available to anyone to study (as we will in this book); if you download the code (the official site is [http://www.kernel.org](http://www.kernel.org)) or check the sources on a Linux CD, you will be able to explore, from top to bottom, one of the most successful modern operating systems. This book, in fact, assumes you have the source code on hand and can apply what we say to your own explorations.

Technically speaking, Linux is a true Unix kernel, although it is not a full Unix operating system because it does not include all the Unix applications, such as filesystem utilities, windowing systems and graphical desktops, system administrator commands, text editors, compilers, and so on. However, because most of these programs are freely available under the GPL, they can be installed in every Linux-based system.

Because the Linux kernel requires so much additional software to provide a useful environment, many Linux users prefer to rely on commercial distributions, available on CD-ROM, to get the code included in a standard Unix system. Alternatively, the code may be obtained from several different sites, for instance [http://www.kernel.org](http://www.kernel.org). Several distributions put the Linux source code in the */usr/src/linux* directory. In the rest of this book, all file pathnames will refer implicitly to the Linux source code directory.

<h2 id="1.1">1.1 Linux与其它类Unix内核对比</h2>

The various Unix-like systems on the market, some of which have a long history and show signs of archaic practices, differ in many important respects. All commercial variants were derived from either SVR4 or 4.4BSD, and all tend to agree on some common standards like IEEE’s Portable Operating Systems based on Unix (POSIX) and X/Open’s Common Applications Environment (CAE).

The current standards specify only an application programming interface (API)—that is, a well-defined environment in which user programs should run. Therefore, the standards do not impose any restriction on internal design choices of a compliant kernel.

To define a common user interface, Unix-like kernels often share fundamental design ideas and features. In this respect, Linux is comparable with the other Unix-like operating systems. Reading this book and studying the Linux kernel, therefore, may help you understand the other Unix variants, too.

The 2.6 version of the Linux kernel aims to be compliant with the IEEE POSIX standard. This, of course, means that most existing Unix programs can be compiled and executed on a Linux system with very little effort or even without the need for patches to the source code. Moreover, Linux includes all the features of a modern Unix operating system, such as virtual memory, a virtual filesystem, lightweight processes, Unix signals, SVR4 interprocess communications, support for Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) systems, and so on.

When Linus Torvalds wrote the first kernel, he referred to some classical books on Unix internals, like Maurice Bach’s *The Design of the Unix Operating System* (Prentice Hall, 1986). Actually, Linux still has some bias toward the Unix baseline described in Bach’s book (i.e., SVR2). However, Linux doesn’t stick to any particular variant. Instead, it tries to adopt the best features and design choices of several different Unix kernels.

The following list describes how Linux competes against some well-known commercial Unix kernels:

* Monolithic kernel

    It is a large, complex do-it-yourself program, composed of several logically different components. In this, it is quite conventional; most commercial Unix variants are monolithic. (Notable exceptions are the Apple Mac OS X and the GNU Hurd operating systems, both derived from the Carnegie-Mellon’s Mach, which follow a microkernel approach.)

* Compiled and statically linked traditional Unix kernels

    Most modern kernels can dynamically load and unload some portions of the kernel code (typically, device drivers), which are usually called modules. Linux’s support for modules is very good, because it is able to automatically load and unload modules on demand. Among the main commercial Unix variants, only the SVR4.2 and Solaris kernels have a similar feature.

* 内核线程

    Some Unix kernels, such as Solaris and SVR4.2/MP, are organized as a set of kernel threads. A kernel thread is an execution context that can be independently scheduled; it may be associated with a user program, or it may run only some kernel functions. Context switches between kernel threads are usually much less expensive than context switches between ordinary processes, because the former usually operate on a common address space. Linux uses kernel threads in a very limited way to execute a few kernel functions periodically; however, they do not represent the basic execution context abstraction. (That’s the topic of the next item.)

* 支持多线程应用程序

    Most modern operating systems have some kind of support for multithreaded applications—that is, user programs that are designed in terms of many relatively independent execution flows that share a large portion of the application data structures. A multithreaded user application could be composed of many lightweight processes (LWP), which are processes that can operate on a common address space, common physical memory pages, common opened files, and so on. Linux defines its own version of lightweight processes, which is different from the types used on other systems such as SVR4 and Solaris. While all the commercial Unix variants of LWPare based on kernel threads, Linux regards lightweight processes as the basic execution context and handles them via the nonstandard `clone()` system call.

* 可抢占式内核

    When compiled with the “Preemptible Kernel” option, Linux 2.6 can arbitrarily interleave execution flows while they are in privileged mode. Besides Linux 2.6, a few other conventional, general-purpose Unix systems, such as Solaris and Mach 3.0, are fully preemptive kernels. SVR4.2/MP introduces some fixed preemption points as a method to get limited preemption capability.

* 支持多处理器

    Several Unix kernel variants take advantage of multiprocessor systems. Linux 2.6 supports symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) for different memory models, including NUMA: the system can use multiple processors and each processor can handle any task—there is no discrimination among them. Although a few parts of the kernel code are still serialized by means of a single “big kernel lock,” it is fair to say that Linux 2.6 makes a near optimal use of SMP.

* 文件系统

    Linux’s standard filesystems come in many flavors. You can use the plain old Ext2 filesystem if you don’t have specific needs. You might switch to Ext3 if you want to avoid lengthy filesystem checks after a system crash. If you’ll have to deal with many small files, the ReiserFS filesystem is likely to be the best choice. Besides Ext3 and ReiserFS, several other journaling filesystems can be used in Linux; they include IBM AIX’s Journaling File System (JFS) and Silicon Graphics IRIX’s XFS filesystem. Thanks to a powerful object-oriented Virtual File System technology (inspired by Solaris and SVR4), porting a foreign filesystem to Linux is generally easier than porting to other kernels.

* STREAMS

    Linux has no analog to the STREAMS I/O subsystem introduced in SVR4, although it is included now in most Unix kernels and has become the preferred interface for writing device drivers, terminal drivers, and network protocols.

This assessment suggests that Linux is fully competitive nowadays with commercial operating systems. Moreover, Linux has several features that make it an exciting operating system. Commercial Unix kernels often introduce new features to gain a larger slice of the market, but these features are not necessarily useful, stable, or productive. As a matter of fact, modern Unix kernels tend to be quite bloated. By contrast, Linux—together with the other open source operating systems—doesn’t suffer from the restrictions and the conditioning imposed by the market, hence it can freely evolve according to the ideas of its designers (mainly Linus Torvalds). Specifically, Linux offers the following advantages over its commercial competitors:

* **Linux是免费的**

    You can install a complete Unix system at no expense other than the hardware (of course).

* **Linux可完全定制化**

    Thanks to the compilation options, you can customize the kernel by selecting only the features really needed. Moreover, thanks to the GPL, you are allowed to freely read and modify the source code of the kernel and of all system programs.

* **Linux可以运行在低端也不贵的硬件设备上**

    You are able to build a network server using an old Intel 80386 system with 4 MB of RAM.

* **Linux功能强大**

    Linux systems are very fast, because they fully exploit the features of the hardware components. The main Linux goal is efficiency, and indeed many design choices of commercial variants, like the STREAMS I/O subsystem, have been rejected by Linus because of their implied performance penalty.

* **Linux开发者都是及其优秀的**

    Linux systems are very stable; they have a very low failure rate and system maintenance time.

* **Linux内核可以小而紧凑**

    It is possible to fit a kernel image, including a few system programs, on just one 1.44 MB floppy disk. As far as we know, none of the commercial Unix variants is able to boot from a single floppy disk.

* **Linux与许多常见的系统兼容**

    Linux lets you directly mount filesystems for all versions of MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, SVR4, OS/2, Mac OS X, Solaris, SunOS, NEXTSTEP, many BSD variants, and so on. Linux also is able to operate with many network layers, such as Ethernet (as well as Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet), Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), High Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI), IEEE 802.11 (Wireless LAN), and IEEE 802.15 (Bluetooth). By using suitable libraries, Linux systems are even able to directly run programs written for other operating systems. For example, Linux is able to execute some applications written for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, SVR3 and R4, 4.4BSD, SCO Unix, Xenix, and others on the 80x86 platform.

* **Linux具有良好的支持**

    Believe it or not, it may be a lot easier to get patches and updates for Linux than for any proprietary operating system. The answer to a problem often comes back within a few hours after sending a message to some newsgroup or mailing list. Moreover, drivers for Linux are usually available a few weeks after new hardware products have been introduced on the market. By contrast, hardware manufacturers release device drivers for only a few commercial operating systems—usually Microsoft’s. Therefore, all commercial Unix variants run on a restricted subset of hardware components.

With an estimated installed base of several tens of millions, people who are used to certain features that are standard under other operating systems are starting to expect the same from Linux. In that regard, the demand on Linux developers is also increasing. Luckily, though, Linux has evolved under the close direction of Linus and his subsystem maintainers to accommodate the needs of the masses.

<h2 id="1.2">1.2 硬件依赖</h2>

<h2 id="1.3">1.3 Linux版本</h2>

Up to kernel version 2.5, Linux identified kernels through a simple numbering scheme. Each version was characterized by three numbers, separated by periods. The first two numbers were used to identify the version; the third number identified the release. The first version number, namely 2, has stayed unchanged since 1996. The second version number identified the type of kernel: if it was even, it denoted a stable version; otherwise, it denoted a development version.

As the name suggests, stable versions were thoroughly checked by Linux distributors and kernel hackers. A new stable version was released only to address bugs and to add new device drivers. Development versions, on the other hand, differed quite significantly from one another; kernel developers were free to experiment with different solutions that occasionally lead to drastic kernel changes. Users who relied on development versions for running applications could experience unpleasant surprises when upgrading their kernel to a newer release.

During development of Linux kernel version 2.6, however, a significant change in the version numbering scheme has taken place. Basically, the second number no longer identifies stable or development versions; thus, nowadays kernel developers introduce large and significant changes in the current kernel version 2.6. A new kernel 2.7 branch will be created only when kernel developers will have to test a really disruptive change; this 2.7 branch will lead to a new current kernel version, or it will be backported to the 2.6 version, or finally it will simply be dropped as a dead end.

The new model of Linux development implies that two kernels having the same version but different release numbers—for instance, 2.6.10 and 2.6.11—can differ significantly even in core components and in fundamental algorithms. Thus, when a new kernel release appears, it is potentially unstable and buggy. To address this problem, the kernel developers may release patched versions of any kernel, which are identified by a fourth number in the version numbering scheme. For instance, at the time this paragraph was written, the latest “stable” kernel version was 2.6.11.12. Please be aware that the kernel version described in this book is Linux 2.6.11.


<h2 id="1.4">1.4 操作系统基本概念</h2>

Each computer system includes a basic set of programs called the operating system. The most important program in the set is called the kernel. It is loaded into RAM when the system boots and contains many critical procedures that are needed for the system to operate. The other programs are less crucial utilities; they can provide a wide variety of interactive experiences for the user—as well as doing all the jobs the user bought the computer for—but the essential shape and capabilities of the system are determined by the kernel. The kernel provides key facilities to everything else on the system and determines many of the characteristics of higher software. Hence, we often use the term “operating system” as a synonym for “kernel.”

The operating system must fulfill two main objectives:

* Interact with the hardware components, servicing all low-level programmable elements included in the hardware platform.

* Provide an execution environment to the applications that run on the computer system (the so-called user programs).

Some operating systems allow all user programs to directly play with the hardware components (a typical example is MS-DOS). In contrast, a Unix-like operating system hides all low-level details concerning the physical organization of the computer from applications run by the user. When a program wants to use a hardware resource, it must issue a request to the operating system. The kernel evaluates the request and, if it chooses to grant the resource, interacts with the proper hardware components on behalf of the user program.

To enforce this mechanism, modern operating systems rely on the availability of specific hardware features that forbid user programs to directly interact with low-level hardware components or to access arbitrary memory locations. In particular, the hardware introduces at least two different execution modes for the CPU: a nonprivileged mode for user programs and a privileged mode for the kernel. Unix calls these User Mode and Kernel Mode, respectively.

In the rest of this chapter, we introduce the basic concepts that have motivated the design of Unix over the past two decades, as well as Linux and other operating systems. While the concepts are probably familiar to you as a Linux user, these sections try to delve into them a bit more deeply than usual to explain the requirements they place on an operating system kernel. These broad considerations refer to virtually all Unix-like systems. The other chapters of this book will hopefully help you understand the Linux kernel internals.

<h3 id="1.4.1">1.4.1 多用户系统</h3>

A multiuser system is a computer that is able to concurrently and independently execute several applications belonging to two or more users. Concurrently means that applications can be active at the same time and contend for the various resources such as CPU, memory, hard disks, and so on. Independently means that each application can perform its task with no concern for what the applications of the other users are doing. Switching from one application to another, of course, slows down each of them and affects the response time seen by the users. Many of the complexities of modern operating system kernels, which we will examine in this book, are present to minimize the delays enforced on each program and to provide the user with responses that are as fast as possible.

Multiuser operating systems must include several features:

* An authentication mechanism for verifying the user’s identity

* protection mechanism against buggy user programs that could block other applications running in the system

* A protection mechanism against malicious user programs that could interfere with or spy on the activity of other users

* An accounting mechanism that limits the amount of resource units assigned to each user

To ensure safe protection mechanisms, operating systems must use the hardware protection associated with the CPU privileged mode. Otherwise, a user program would be able to directly access the system circuitry and overcome the imposed bounds. Unix is a multiuser system that enforces the hardware protection of system resources.

<h3 id="1.4.2">1.4.2 用户和组的概念</h3>

In a multiuser system, each user has a private space on the machine; typically, he owns some quota of the disk space to store files, receives private mail messages, and so on. The operating system must ensure that the private portion of a user space is visible only to its owner. In particular, it must ensure that no user can exploit a system application for the purpose of violating the private space of another user.

All users are identified by a unique number called the *User ID*, or *UID*. Usually only a restricted number of persons are allowed to make use of a computer system. When one of these users starts a working session, the system asks for a login name and a password. If the user does not input a valid pair, the system denies access. Because the password is assumed to be secret, the user’s privacy is ensured.

To selectively share material with other users, each user is a member of one or more user groups, which are identified by a unique number called a *user group ID*. Each file is associated with exactly one group. For example, access can be set so the user owning the file has read and write privileges, the group has read-only privileges, and other users on the system are denied access to the file.

Any Unix-like operating system has a special user called *root* or *superuser*. The system administrator must log in as root to handle user accounts, perform maintenance tasks such as system backups and program upgrades, and so on. The root user can do almost everything, because the operating system does not apply the usual protection mechanisms to her. In particular, the root user can access every file on the system and can manipulate every running user program.

<h3 id="1.4.3">1.4.3 进程</h3>

All operating systems use one fundamental abstraction: the *process*. A process can be defined either as “an instance of a program in execution” or as the “execution context” of a running program. In traditional operating systems, a process executes a single sequence of instructions in an address space; the address space is the set of memory addresses that the process is allowed to reference. Modern operating systems allow processes with multiple execution flows—that is, multiple sequences of instructions executed in the same address space.

Multiuser systems must enforce an execution environment in which several processes can be active concurrently and contend for system resources, mainly the CPU. Systems that allow concurrent active processes are said to be multiprogramming or multiprocessing. It is important to distinguish programs from processes; several processes can execute the same program concurrently, while the same process can execute several programs sequentially.

On uniprocessor systems, just one process can hold the CPU, and hence just one execution flow can progress at a time. In general, the number of CPUs is always restricted, and therefore only a few processes can progress at once. An operating system component called the scheduler chooses the process that can progress. Some operating systems allow only nonpreemptable processes, which means that the scheduler is invoked only when a process voluntarily relinquishes the CPU. But processes of a multiuser system must be preemptable; the operating system tracks how long each process holds the CPU and periodically activates the scheduler.

Unix is a multiprocessing operating system with preemptable processes. Even when no user is logged in and no application is running, several system processes monitor the peripheral devices. In particular, several processes listen at the system terminals waiting for user logins. When a user inputs a login name, the listening process runs a program that validates the user password. If the user identity is acknowledged, the process creates another process that runs a shell into which commands are entered. When a graphical display is activated, one process runs the window manager, and each window on the display is usually run by a separate process. When a user creates a graphics shell, one process runs the graphics windows and a second process runs the shell into which the user can enter the commands. For each user command, the shell process creates another process that executes the corresponding program.

Unix-like operating systems adopt a process/kernel model. Each process has the illusion that it’s the only process on the machine, and it has exclusive access to the operating system services. Whenever a process makes a system call (i.e., a request to the kernel, see [Chapter 10](#10)), the hardware changes the privilege mode from User Mode to Kernel Mode, and the process starts the execution of a kernel procedure with a strictly limited purpose. In this way, the operating system acts within the execution context of the process in order to satisfy its request. Whenever the request is fully satisfied, the kernel procedure forces the hardware to return to User Mode and the process continues its execution from the instruction following the system call.

<h3 id="1.4.4">1.4.4 内核架构</h3>

As stated before, most Unix kernels are monolithic: each kernel layer is integrated into the whole kernel program and runs in Kernel Mode on behalf of the current process. In contrast, microkernel operating systems demand a very small set of functions from the kernel, generally including a few synchronization primitives, a simple scheduler, and an interprocess communication mechanism. Several system processes that run on top of the microkernel implement other operating system–layer functions, like memory allocators, device drivers, and system call handlers.

Although academic research on operating systems is oriented toward microkernels, such operating systems are generally slower than monolithic ones, because the explicit message passing between the different layers of the operating system has a cost. However, microkernel operating systems might have some theoretical advantages over monolithic ones. Microkernels force the system programmers to adopt a modularized approach, because each operating system layer is a relatively independent program that must interact with the other layers through well-defined and clean software interfaces. Moreover, an existing microkernel operating system can be easily ported to other architectures fairly easily, because all hardware-dependent components are generally encapsulated in the microkernel code. Finally, microkernel operating systems tend to make better use of random access memory (RAM) than monolithic ones, because system processes that aren’t implementing needed functionalities might be swapped out or destroyed.

To achieve many of the theoretical advantages of microkernels without introducing performance penalties, the Linux kernel offers modules. A module is an object file whose code can be linked to (and unlinked from) the kernel at runtime. The object code usually consists of a set of functions that implements a filesystem, a device driver, or other features at the kernel’s upper layer. The module, unlike the external layers of microkernel operating systems, does not run as a specific process. Instead, it is executed in Kernel Mode on behalf of the current process, like any other statically linked kernel function.

使用模块主要有以下优点：

* 模块化方法

    Because any module can be linked and unlinked at runtime, system programmers must introduce well-defined software interfaces to access the data structures handled by modules. This makes it easy to develop new modules.

* 平台独立

    Even if it may rely on some specific hardware features, a module doesn’t depend on a fixed hardware platform. For example, a disk driver module that relies on the SCSI standard works as well on an IBM-compatible PC as it does on Hewlett-Packard’s Alpha.

* 节省内存使用

    A module can be linked to the running kernel when its functionality is required and unlinked when it is no longer useful; this is quite useful for small embedded systems.

* 没有性能损失

    Once linked in, the object code of a module is equivalent to the object code of the statically linked kernel. Therefore, no explicit message passing is required when the functions of the module are invoked.

<h2 id="1.5">1.5 Unix文件系统综述</h2>

The Unix operating system design is centered on its filesystem, which has several interesting characteristics. We’ll review the most significant ones, since they will be mentioned quite often in forthcoming chapters.

<h3 id="1.5.1">1.5.1 文件</h3>

A Unix file is an information container structured as a sequence of bytes; the kernel does not interpret the contents of a file. Many programming libraries implement higher-level abstractions, such as records structured into fields and record addressing based on keys. However, the programs in these libraries must rely on system calls offered by the kernel. From the user’s point of view, files are organized in a tree-structured namespace, as shown in Figure 1-1.

Unix文件是由字节序列构成的信息容器；内核不解释文件的内容。许多编程库在其上实现了更高级的抽象，比如record结构，由基于键值对的方式构成。但是，这些程序还是依赖于内核提供的系统调用接口。从用户的观点来看，文件就像组织在一个树形结构中，如图1-1所示。

<img id="Figure_1-1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_1_1.PNG">

图1-1 目录树示例

All the nodes of the tree, except the leaves, denote directory names. A directory node
contains information about the files and directories just beneath it. A file or directory
name consists of a sequence of arbitrary ASCII characters,* with the exception of
/ and of the null character \0. Most filesystems place a limit on the length of a filename,
typically no more than 255 characters. The directory corresponding to the
root of the tree is called the root directory. By convention, its name is a slash (/).
Names must be different within the same directory, but the same name may be used
in different directories.

Unix associates a current working directory with each process (see the section “The
Process/Kernel Model” later in this chapter); it belongs to the process execution context,
and it identifies the directory currently used by the process. To identify a specific
file, the process uses a pathname, which consists of slashes alternating with a
sequence of directory names that lead to the file. If the first item in the pathname is
a slash, the pathname is said to be absolute, because its starting point is the root
directory. Otherwise, if the first item is a directory name or filename, the pathname
is said to be relative, because its starting point is the process’s current directory.

While specifying filenames, the notations “.” and “..” are also used. They denote the
current working directory and its parent directory, respectively. If the current working
directory is the root directory, “.” and “..” coincide.


<h3 id="1.5.2">1.5.2 硬链接和软链接</h3>

A filename included in a directory is called a file hard link, or more simply, a link.
The same file may have several links included in the same directory or in different
ones, so it may have several filenames.

The Unix command:

    $ ln p1 p2

is used to create a new hard link that has the pathname `p2` for a file identified by the pathname p1.

Hard links have two limitations:

* It is not possible to create hard links for directories. Doing so might transform the directory tree into a graph with cycles, thus making it impossible to locate a file according to its name.

* Links can be created only among files included in the same filesystem. This is a serious limitation, because modern Unix systems may include several filesystems located on different disks and/or partitions, and users may be unaware of the physical divisions between them.

To overcome these limitations, soft links (also called symbolic links) were introduced
a long time ago. Symbolic links are short files that contain an arbitrary pathname of
another file. The pathname may refer to any file or directory located in any filesystem;
it may even refer to a nonexistent file.

The Unix command:

    $ ln -s p1 p2

creates a new soft link with pathname `p2` that refers to pathname `p1`. When this command
is executed, the filesystem extracts the directory part of `p2` and creates a new
entry in that directory of type symbolic link, with the name indicated by `p2`. This new
file contains the name indicated by pathname `p1`. This way, each reference to `p2` can
be translated automatically into a reference to `p1`.

<h3 id="1.5.3">1.5.3 文件类型</h3>

Unix系统具有如下的文件类型：

* 常规文件
* 目录
* 符号链接
* 块设备文件
* 字符设备文件
* 管道和命名管道（也称为FIFO）
* 套接字（Socket）

The first three file types are constituents of any Unix filesystem. Their implementation is described in detail in Chapter 18.

Device files are related both to I/O devices, and to device drivers integrated into the kernel. For example, when a program accesses a device file, it acts directly on the I/O device associated with that file (see [Chapter 13](#13)).

Pipes and sockets are special files used for interprocess communication (see the section “Synchronization and Critical Regions” later in this chapter; also see [Chapter 19](#19)).

<h3 id="1.5.4">1.5.4 文件描述符和Inode</h3>

Unix makes a clear distinction between the contents of a file and the information about a file. With the exception of device files and files of special filesystems, each file consists of a sequence of bytes. The file does not include any control information, such as its length or an end-of-file (EOF) delimiter.

All information needed by the filesystem to handle a file is included in a data structure called an inode. Each file has its own inode, which the filesystem uses to identify the file.

While filesystems and the kernel functions handling them can vary widely from one Unix system to another, they must always provide at least the following attributes, which are specified in the POSIX standard:

* File type (see the previous section)
* Number of hard links associated with the file
* File length in bytes
* Device ID (i.e., an identifier of the device containing the file)
* Inode number that identifies the file within the filesystem
* UID of the file owner
* User group ID of the file
* Several timestamps that specify the inode status change time, the last access time, and the last modify time
* Access rights and file mode (see the next section)

<h3 id="1.5.5">1.5.5 访问权限和文件模式</h3>

The potential users of a file fall into three classes:

* The user who is the owner of the file
* The users who belong to the same group as the file, not including the owner
* All remaining users (others)

There are three types of access rights—`read`, `write`, and `execute`—for each of these three classes. Thus, the set of access rights associated with a file consists of nine different binary flags. Three additional flags, called `suid` (Set User ID), `sgid` (Set Group ID), and `sticky`, define the file mode. These flags have the following meanings when applied to executable files:

* suid

    A process executing a file normally keeps the User ID (UID) of the process owner. However, if the executable file has the suid flag set, the process gets the UID of the file owner.

* sgid

    A process executing a file keeps the user group ID of the process group. However, if the executable file has the sgid flag set, the process gets the user group ID of the file.

* sticky

    An executable file with the sticky flag set corresponds to a request to the kernel to keep the program in memory after its execution terminates.

When a file is created by a process, its owner ID is the UID of the process. Its owner user group ID can be either the process group ID of the creator process or the user group ID of the parent directory, depending on the value of the sgid flag of the parent directory.

<h3 id="1.5.6">1.5.6 操作文件的系统调用</h3>

When a user accesses the contents of either a regular file or a directory, he actually
accesses some data stored in a hardware block device. In this sense, a filesystem is a
user-level view of the physical organization of a hard disk partition. Because a process
in User Mode cannot directly interact with the low-level hardware components,
each actual file operation must be performed in Kernel Mode. Therefore, the Unix
operating system defines several system calls related to file handling.

All Unix kernels devote great attention to the efficient handling of hardware block
devices to achieve good overall system performance. In the chapters that follow, we
will describe topics related to file handling in Linux and specifically how the kernel
reacts to file-related system calls. To understand those descriptions, you will need to
know how the main file-handling system calls are used; these are described in the
next section.

<h4 id="1.5.6.1">1.5.6.1 打开文件</h4>

Processes can access only “opened” files. To open a file, the process invokes the system call:

    fd = open(path, flag, mode)

The three parameters have the following meanings:

* path

    Denotes the pathname (relative or absolute) of the file to be opened.

* flag

    Specifies how the file must be opened (e.g., read, write, read/write, append). It also can specify whether a nonexisting file should be created.

* mode

    Specifies the access rights of a newly created file.

This system call creates an “open file” object and returns an identifier called a `file` descriptor. An open file object contains:

* Some file-handling data structures, such as a set of flags specifying how the file has been opened, an offset field that denotes the current position in the file from which the next operation will take place (the so-called file pointer), and so on.

* Some pointers to kernel functions that the process can invoke. The set of permitted functions depends on the value of the flag parameter.

We discuss open file objects in detail in Chapter 12. Let’s limit ourselves here to describing some general properties specified by the POSIX semantics.

* A file descriptor represents an interaction between a process and an opened file, while an open file object contains data related to that interaction. The same open file object may be identified by several file descriptors in the same process.

* Several processes may concurrently open the same file. In this case, the filesystem assigns a separate file descriptor to each file, along with a separate open file object. When this occurs, the Unix filesystem does not provide any kind of synchronization among the I/O operations issued by the processes on the same file. However, several system calls such as `flock()` are available to allow processes to synchronize themselves on the entire file or on portions of it (see [Chapter 12](#12)).

To create a new file, the process also may invoke the `creat()` system call, which is handled by the kernel exactly like `open()`.

<h4 id="1.5.6.2">1.5.6.2 访问打开的文件</h4>
<h4 id="1.5.6.3">1.5.6.3 关闭文件</h4>
<h4 id="1.5.6.2">1.5.6.2 重命名和删除文件</h4>

<h2 id="1.6">1.6 Unix内核综述</h2>

Unix kernels provide an execution environment in which applications may run. Therefore, the kernel must implement a set of services and corresponding interfaces. Applications use those interfaces and do not usually interact directly with hardware resources.

<h3 id="1.6.1">1.6.1 进程/内核模型</h3>

As already mentioned, a CPU can run in either User Mode or Kernel Mode. Actually, some CPUs can have more than two execution states. For instance, the 80×86 microprocessors have four different execution states. But all standard Unix kernels use only Kernel Mode and User Mode.

When a program is executed in User Mode, it cannot directly access the kernel data structures or the kernel programs. When an application executes in Kernel Mode, however, these restrictions no longer apply. Each CPU model provides special instructions to switch from User Mode to Kernel Mode and vice versa. A program usually executes in User Mode and switches to Kernel Mode only when requesting a service provided by the kernel. When the kernel has satisfied the program’s request, it puts the program back in User Mode.

Processes are dynamic entities that usually have a limited life span within the system. The task of creating, eliminating, and synchronizing the existing processes is delegated to a group of routines in the kernel.

The kernel itself is not a process but a process manager. The process/kernel model assumes that processes that require a kernel service use specific programming constructs called system calls. Each system call sets up the group of parameters that identifies the process request and then executes the hardware-dependent CPU instruction to switch from User Mode to Kernel Mode.

Besides user processes, Unix systems include a few privileged processes called `kernel threads` with the following characteristics:

* They run in Kernel Mode in the kernel address space.
* They do not interact with users, and thus do not require terminal devices.
* They are usually created during system startup and remain alive until the system is shut down.

On a uniprocessor system, only one process is running at a time, and it may run
either in User or in Kernel Mode. If it runs in Kernel Mode, the processor is executing
some kernel routine. Figure 1-2 illustrates examples of transitions between User
and Kernel Mode. Process 1 in User Mode issues a system call, after which the process
switches to Kernel Mode, and the system call is serviced. Process 1 then resumes
execution in User Mode until a timer interrupt occurs, and the scheduler is activated
in Kernel Mode. A process switch takes place, and Process 2 starts its execution in
User Mode until a hardware device raises an interrupt. As a consequence of the interrupt,
Process 2 switches to Kernel Mode and services the interrupt.

<img id="Figure_1-2" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_1_2.PNG">

图1-2 用户态和内核模式之间的转换

Unix kernels do much more than handle system calls; in fact, kernel routines can be activated in several ways:

* A process invokes a system call.
* The CPU executing the process signals an exception, which is an unusual condition such as an invalid instruction. The kernel handles the exception on behalf of the process that caused it.
* A peripheral device issues an interrupt signal to the CPU to notify it of an event such as a request for attention, a status change, or the completion of an I/O operation. Each interrupt signal is dealt by a kernel program called an interrupt handler. Because peripheral devices operate asynchronously with respect to the CPU, interrupts occur at unpredictable times.
* A kernel thread is executed. Because it runs in Kernel Mode, the corresponding program must be considered part of the kernel.

<h3 id="1.6.2">1.6.2 进程实现</h3>

To let the kernel manage processes, each process is represented by a *process descriptor* that includes information about the current state of the process.

When the kernel stops the execution of a process, it saves the current contents of several processor registers in the process descriptor. These include:

* 程序计数器(PC)和堆栈指针寄存器(SP)
* 通用目的寄存器
* 浮点寄存器
* 处理器控制寄存器(Processor Status Word)，包含CPU状态信息
* 内存管理寄存器，用于跟踪进程访问的RAM

When the kernel decides to resume executing a process, it uses the proper process descriptor fields to load the CPU registers. Because the stored value of the program counter points to the instruction following the last instruction executed, the process resumes execution at the point where it was stopped.

When a process is not executing on the CPU, it is waiting for some event. Unix kernels distinguish many wait states, which are usually implemented by queues of process descriptors; each (possibly empty) queue corresponds to the set of processes waiting for a specific event.

<h1 id="2">2 内存寻址</h1>

This chapter deals with addressing techniques. Luckily, an operating system is not forced to keep track of physical memory all by itself; today’s microprocessors include several hardware circuits to make memory management both more efficient and more robust so that programming errors cannot cause improper accesses to memory outside the program.

本章讲述寻址技术。幸运的是，操作系统不需要自己跟踪管理物理内存。今天的微处理器都包含一些硬件电路，使得内存管理更为高效，也更为健壮，所以，编程错误就不会导致程序外的内存访问不当。

As in the rest of this book, we offer details in this chapter on how 80×86 microprocessors address memory chips and how Linux uses the available addressing circuits. You will find, we hope, that when you learn the implementation details on Linux’s most popular platform you will better understand both the general theory of paging and how to research the implementation on other platforms.

在本书的其余部分，我们将以x86微处理器为例，讲述它如何寻址内存芯片和Linux如何使用这些寻址单元。希望通过讲解这个最为流行的平台上的Linux实现，我们可以理解分页机制的通用理论，并能够将这些理论应用到别的平台上。

This is the first of three chapters related to memory management; [Chapter 8](#8) discusses how the kernel allocates main memory to itself, while [Chapter 9](#9) considers how linear addresses are assigned to processes.

这是关于内存管理相关的3章中的第1章。在[第8章](#8)中讨论内核如何给自身分配内存，而[第9章](#9)如何分配线性地址给进程。

<h2 id="2.1">2.1 内存地址</h2>

Programmers casually refer to a memory address as the way to access the contents of a memory cell. But when dealing with 80×86 microprocessors, we have to distinguish three kinds of addresses:

程序员通常使用内存地址访问内存单元中的内容。但是，对于x86处理器，需要区分下面3种地址（[ARM处理器是没有逻辑地址这个概念的，也就是说它们指令中的寻址方式是不同的。]()）：

1. 逻辑地址

    Included in the machine language instructions to specify the address of an operand or of an instruction. This type of address embodies the well-known 80×86 segmented architecture that forces MS-DOS and Windows programmers to divide their programs into segments. Each logical address consists of a segment and an offset (or displacement) that denotes the distance from the start of the segment to the actual address.

    在机器语言指令中用来指定算子或指令的地址。这类地址加强了x86架构的分段架构，但迫使基于MS-DOS和Windows系统编程的程序员将他们的程序也分段。每个逻辑地址由一个段地址和偏移量组成，偏移量描述段地址偏离实际物理地址的距离。

2. 线性地址（也被称为虚拟地址）

    A single 32-bit unsigned integer that can be used to address up to 4 GB—that is, up to 4,294,967,296 memory cells. Linear addresses are usually represented in hexadecimal notation; their values range from 0x00000000 to 0xffffffff.

    32位系统的寻址空间是4GB，也就是寻址范围是0x00000000到0xffffffff。

3. 物理地址

    Used to address memory cells in memory chips. They correspond to the electrical signals sent along the address pins of the microprocessor to the memory bus. Physical addresses are represented as 32-bit or 36-bit unsigned integers.

    用来描述实际物理内存芯片的地址空间。也就是说，这些地址是发送到内存总线上的电信号。物理地址可以是32位，也可以是36位。

The Memory Management Unit (MMU) transforms a logical address into a linear address by means of a hardware circuit called a segmentation unit; subsequently, a second hardware circuit called a paging unit transforms the linear address into a physical address (see Figure 2-1).

内存管理单元（MMU）负责把逻辑地址转换成物理地址：首先，段管理单元把逻辑地址转换成线性地址；然后，页管理单元负责把线性地址转换成物理地址。如图2-1所示，

<img id="Figure_2-1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_2_1.PNG">

图2-1 逻辑地址的转换过程

In multiprocessor systems, all CPUs usually share the same memory; this means that RAM chips may be accessed concurrently by independent CPUs. Because read or write operations on a RAM chip must be performed serially, a hardware circuit called a memory arbiter is inserted between the bus and every RAM chip. Its role is to grant access to a CPU if the chip is free and to delay it if the chip is busy servicing a request by another processor. Even uniprocessor systems use memory arbiters, because they include specialized processors called DMA controllers that operate concurrently with the CPU (see the section “[Direct Memory Access (DMA)](#13.4.5)” in Chapter 13). In the case of multiprocessor systems, the structure of the arbiter is more complex because it has more input ports. The dual Pentium, for instance, maintains a two-port arbiter at each chip entrance and requires that the two CPUs exchange synchronization messages before attempting to use the common bus. From the programming point of view, the arbiter is hidden because it is managed by hardware circuits.

在多核系统中，所有CPU共享内存，这意味着可能对内存发生并发访问。但是，对内存的读写操作必须是串行的，所以，添加了一个称为内存仲裁的硬件单元，负责CPU对内存访问权限的仲裁：如果内存空闲就让CPU访问，如果内存正在被另一个CPU访问就延缓该CPU的请求。即使单处理器系统也会使用内存仲裁，因为还有直接内存访问-DMA方式，同样会造成对内存访问的并发。多核系统中，内存仲裁单元的结构非常复杂，因为它有多个输入端口。比如，双核奔腾处理器，维护着一个2端口的仲裁单元，要求2个CPU在使用公共的总线之前先要交换同步消息。从编程的角度来说，仲裁单元被隐藏了，因为是硬件负责的，无需程序干预。

<h2 id="2.2">2.2 内存分段</h2>

Starting with the 80286 model, Intel microprocessors perform address translation in two different ways called real mode and protected mode. We’ll focus in the next sections on address translation when protected mode is enabled. Real mode exists mostly to maintain processor compatibility with older models and to allow the operating system to bootstrap (see Appendix A for a short description of real mode).

从80286开始，Intel处理器将地址转换分为实模式转换、保护模式转换。接下来我们主要讨论保护模式下的地址转换。之所以保留实模式，主要是为了和旧模型兼容，以及允许操作系统引导。

<h3 id="2.2.1">2.2.1 段选择器和段寄存器</h3>

A logical address consists of two parts: a segment identifier and an offset that specifies the relative address within the segment. The segment identifier is a 16-bit field called the Segment Selector (see Figure 2-2), while the offset is a 32-bit field. We’ll describe the fields of Segment Selectors in the section “Fast Access to Segment Descriptors” later in this chapter.

逻辑地址被分为2部分：段标识符和偏移量，偏移量指定在段中的相对位置。段标识符是一个16位的位域，称为 **段选择器**（查看图2-2），偏移量是一个32位的位域。我们将在[快速访问段描述符](#2.2.3)一节中描述端选择器的各个位的意义。

图2-2 段选择器格式

To make it easy to retrieve segment selectors quickly, the processor provides segmentation registers whose only purpose is to hold Segment Selectors; these registers are called cs, ss, ds, es, fs, and gs. Although there are only six of them, a program can reuse the same segmentation register for different purposes by saving its content in memory and then restoring it later.

为了简单快速检索段选择器，CPU提供了段寄存器，它的唯一目的就是保存段选择器；这些段寄存器被称为`cs`、`ss`、`ds`、`es`、`fs`和`gs`。尽管只有6个，但是程序可以通过保存其内容到内存中，然后后面再恢复的办法，重复利用这些段寄存器，用作不同的目的。

其中3个寄存器具有特定的用途：

* cs

    代码段寄存器，指向包含程序指令的段。

* ss

    栈的段寄存器，指向包含当前程序栈的段。

* ds

    数据段寄存器，指向包含全局和静态数据的段。

其余的3个寄存器是通用目的寄存器，可以指向任意数据段。

The `cs` register has another important function: it includes a 2-bit field that specifies the Current Privilege Level (CPL) of the CPU. The value 0 denotes the highest privilege level, while the value 3 denotes the lowest one. Linux uses only levels 0 and 3, which are respectively called Kernel Mode and User Mode.

`cs`寄存器还有另外一个重要功能：在其中，有2位表示CPU当前特权级别（CPL）。值为0，表明具有最高优先级，而值为3，表明最低优先级。Linux只使用优先级0和3，分别称为内核模式和用户态。

<h3 id="2.2.2">2.2.2 段描述符</h3>

每一个段都由8个字节的段描述符表示。段描述符即可以存储在全局描述符表（GDT），也可以存储在局部描述符表（LDT）。

通常，只有一个GDT，所有的进程共享。但是如果每个进程还需要创建额外的段，可以拥有自己的LDT。GDT在内存中的地址和大小保存在`gdtr`控制寄存器中，而当前正在使用的LDT的地址和大小保存在`ldtr`寄存器中。

图2-3解释了段描述符的格式；表2-1阐述了各个位域的意义。

表 2-1. 段描述符的各个位域的意义

| 位域名称   | 描述 |
| ---------- | ---- |
| Base   | 保存段描述符的起始地址，硬件单元会自动把3个分立的基地址单元组合成一个32位的地址 |
| G      | 粒度，如果=0，段按字节表示；否则，按4K的倍数表示。|
| Limit  | 该段最后一个内存单元的偏移量，相当于长度。如果G=0，段的大小为1~1MB；否则为4K~4GB。|
| S      | 系统标志：如果被清除，则该段是一个系统段，用来存储关键数据结构，比如LDT；否则，就是正常代码段或数据段。|
| Type   | 段类型和访问权限。|
| DPL    | 描述符特权级别：用来限制对段的访问。它表示访问段所要求的最小CPU特权级别。因此，如果一个段的特权级别被设置为0，则只有CPL也是0的时候才能访问，也就是说只有内核模式才能访问。如果将DPL设置为3，任何CPL的值都可以访问该段，也就是说，什么模式都可以访问该段。|
| P      | 段当前标志:如果段当前没有存储在主存中，则等于0。Linux总是将这个标志置1(第47位)设置为1，因为它从不将整个段交换到磁盘。 |
| D or B | 称为D还是B依赖于该段包含的是代码还是数据。这两种情况下，意义有轻微的不同，如果地址使用的段偏移是32位，则基本设为1，如果是16位，则置0。（详细可以参考英特尔手册）|
| AVL    | 可以被操作系统使用，但Linux忽略该域 |

There are several types of segments, and thus several types of Segment Descriptors. The following list shows the types that are widely used in Linux.

有几种类型的段，就有几种类型的段描述符。下面的列表展示了Linux中使用比较广发的类型：

* *代码段描述符*

    表明该段描述符指向一个代码段；即可以包含在GDT，也可以包含在LDT。S标志置1，表示这是代码段。

* *数据段描述符*

    表明该段描述符指向一个数据段；即可以包含在GDT，也可以包含在LDT。S标志置1，表示这是数据段。栈段就是通过通用数据段实现的。

* *任务状态段描述符*

    表明该段描述符指向一个任务状态段（TSS），也就是说，该段是用来保存处理器各个寄存器的内容的（第3章的[任务状态段](#3.3.2)）；它只能出现在GDT中。相应的`Type`位域使用值11或9，依赖于相应的进程现在是否正在CPU上执行。该类描述符的S标志置0，表示系统段。

* *LDT描述符-LDTD*

    描述段描述符指向包含LDT的段；这样的描述符只能出现在GDT中。相应的`Type`位域值为2。这类描述符的S标志位置0，表示系统段。下一段，我们将会描述x86处理器是怎样决定一个段描述符存储在GDT还是进程的LDT中的。

图2-3 段描述符格式

<h3 id="2.2.3">2.2.3 快速访问段描述符</h3>

We recall that logical addresses consist of a 16-bit Segment Selector and a 32-bit Offset, and that segmentation registers store only the Segment Selector.

我们回忆一下，逻辑地址是由16位段选择器和32位偏移量组成的，段寄存器只存储段选择器。

To speed up the translation of logical addresses into linear addresses, the 80×86 processor provides an additional nonprogrammable register—that is, a register that cannot be set by a programmer—for each of the six programmable segmentation registers. Each nonprogrammable register contains the 8-byte Segment Descriptor (described in the previous section) specified by the Segment Selector contained in the corresponding segmentation register. Every time a Segment Selector is loaded in a segmentation register, the corresponding Segment Descriptor is loaded from memory into the matching nonprogrammable CPU register. From then on, translations of logical addresses referring to that segment can be performed without accessing the GDT or LDT stored in main memory; the processor can refer only directly to the CPU register  containing the Segment Descriptor. Accesses to the GDT or LDT are necessary only when the contents of the segmentation registers change (see Figure 2-4).

为了加速逻辑地址到线性地址的转换，x86处理器为6个可编程寄存器每一个提供了一个额外的非可编程寄存器-也就是说这个寄存器不能由编程者设置-每一个非可编程寄存器包含一个8字节的段描述符（前面描述过），这个描述符由包含在对应的段寄存器中的段描述符指定。每当段选择器被加载到段寄存器中，相应的段描述符就从内存中被加载到匹配的非可编程CPU寄存器中。从那时起，指向那个段的逻辑地址就会被转换，而无需访问存储在内存中的GDT或LDT；处理器只需直接访问包含段描述符的CPU寄存器。只有当段寄存器的内容发生变化的时候，才有访问GDT或LDT的必要（图2-4）。

<img id="Figure_2-4" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_2_4.PNG">

图2-4 段选择器和段描述符

Any Segment Selector includes three fields that are described in Table 2-2.

表 2-2. 段选择器各个位域的意义

| Field name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| index | Identifies the Segment Descriptor entry contained in the GDT or in the LDT (described further in the text following this table). |
| TI    | Table Indicator: specifies whether the Segment Descriptor is included in the GDT (TI = 0) or in the LDT (TI = 1). |
| RPL   | Requestor Privilege Level: specifies the Current Privilege Level of the CPU when the corresponding Segment Selector is loaded into the cs register; it also may be used to selectively weaken the processor privilege level when accessing data segments (see Intel documentation for details). |

| 位域名称   | 描述        |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| index | 标识GDT或LDT中的段描述符位于第几项（表后的文字会进一步描述）。 |
| TI    | 表指示器：指明段描述符被包含在GDT（TI=0）还是LDT（TI=1）中。|
| RPL   | 请求者的特权级别：当相应的段选择器被加载到cs寄存器时，指明CPU当前特权级别；还可用于当访问数据段时，选择性地降低CPU特权级别。 |

Because a Segment Descriptor is 8 bytes long, its relative address inside the GDT or the LDT is obtained by multiplying the 13-bit index field of the Segment Selector by 8. For instance, if the GDT is at 0x00020000 (the value stored in the gdtr register) and the index specified by the Segment Selector is 2, the address of the corresponding Segment Descriptor is 0x00020000 + (2 × 8), or 0x00020010.

因为段描述符是8字节长，所以它在GDT或LDT中的相对地址等于段选择器的index索引乘以8。例如，如果GDT位于地址0x00020000处（这个值存储在`gdtr`寄存器中），段选择器的index索引设为2，相应的段描述符的地址等于`0x00020000 + (2 × 8)`，也就是0x00020010。

The first entry of the GDT is always set to 0. This ensures that logical addresses with a null Segment Selector will be considered invalid, thus causing a processor exception. The maximum number of Segment Descriptors that can be stored in the GDT is 8,191 (i.e., 2^13–1).

GDT中的第1项总是设为0。这保证了如果段选择器的值是null时，该逻辑地址被认为是非法的，产生一个CPU异常。GDT中可以包含的段描述符的最大数量是8191（2^13-1）。

<h3 id="2.2.4">2.2.4 段硬件单元</h3>

Figure 2-5 shows in detail how a logical address is translated into a corresponding linear address. The segmentation unit performs the following operations:

图2-5详细地展示了逻辑地址转换成线性地址的过程。段硬件单元执行下面的操作：

1. Examines the TI field of the Segment Selector to determine which Descriptor Table stores the Segment Descriptor. This field indicates that the Descriptor is either in the GDT (in which case the segmentation unit gets the base linear address of the GDT from the gdtr register) or in the active LDT (in which case the segmentation unit gets the base linear address of that LDT from the ldtr register).

    检查段选择器中的TI位域，决定段描述符存储在哪个描述符表中（GDT还是LDT）。如果是在GDT中，段硬件单元从`gdtr`寄存器中获取GDT的基地址（线性地址）；如果是在LDT中，段硬件单元从`ldtr`寄存器中获取LDT的基地址（线性地址）；

2. Computes the address of the Segment Descriptor from the `index` field of the Segment Selector. The `index` field is multiplied by 8 (the size of a Segment Descriptor), and the result is added to the content of the `gdtr` or `ldtr` register.

    根据段选择器中的`index`位域计算段描述符的地址，把`index*8`加到`gdtr`或`ldtr`寄存器的内容上，就是想要的段描述符的地址，其中8是段描述符的大小。

3. Adds the offset of the logical address to the Base field of the Segment Descriptor, thus obtaining the linear address.

    段描述符的Base位域的内容加上逻辑地址的offset偏移，就可以获得想要的线性地址。

图2-5 转换逻辑地址

Notice that, thanks to the nonprogrammable registers associated with the segmentation registers, the first two operations need to be performed only when a segmentation register has been changed.

值得注意的是，由于非可编程寄存器和段寄存器的组合，只有在段寄存器发生改变的时候才会执行前2步。

<h2 id="2.3">2.3 Linux中的分段机制</h2>

Segmentation has been included in 80×86 microprocessors to encourage programmers to split their applications into logically related entities, such as subroutines or global and local data areas. However, Linux uses segmentation in a very limited way. In fact, segmentation and paging are somewhat redundant, because both can be used to separate the physical address spaces of processes: segmentation can assign a different linear address space to each process, while paging can map the same linear address space into different physical address spaces. Linux prefers paging to segmentation for the following reasons:

x86微处理器包含段就是鼓励编程者将他们的程序分割成逻辑相关的实体，例如子程序、全局和局部数据区域。但是，Linux使用段的方式很有限。事实上，分段和分页在某种程度上是冗余的，因为它们两个都可以分割进程的物理地址空间：分段可以给每一个进程分配不同的线性地址空间，而分页可以映射同一个线性地址到不同的物理地址空间。Linux更喜欢分页而不是分段，原因如下：

* Memory management is simpler when all processes use the same segment register values—that is, when they share the same set of linear addresses.

    当所有的进程使用相同的段寄存器值时，内存管理更简单-也就是说，它们共享线性地址。

* One of the design objectives of Linux is portability to a wide range of architectures; RISC architectures in particular have limited support for segmentation.

    Linux设计的目标之一就是可以移植到各种各样的架构上；而RISC指令集的架构基本上不支持分段机制。

The 2.6 version of Linux uses segmentation only when required by the 80×86 architecture.

Linux2.6版本只有x86架构需要时才使用分段。

All Linux processes running in User Mode use the same pair of segments to address instructions and data. These segments are called *user code segment* and *user data segment*, respectively. Similarly, all Linux processes running in Kernel Mode use the same pair of segments to address instructions and data: they are called *kernel code segment* and *kernel data segment*, respectively. Table 2-3 shows the values of the Segment Descriptor fields for these four crucial segments.

运行在用户态的所有Linux进程使用一对相同的段寻址指令和数据，它们分别称为用户代码段和用户数据段。相似的，运行在内核模式的所有Linux进程也使用一对相同的段寻址指令和数据，它们分别称为内核代码段和内核数据段。表2-3展示了四个主要Linux段的段描述符的各个位域的值。

表2-3 四个主要Linux段的段描述符的各个位域的值

| Segment     | Base       | G | Limit   | S | Type | DPL | D/B | P |
| ----------- | ---------- | - | -----   | - | ---- | --- | --- | - |
| user code   | 0x00000000 | 1 | 0xfffff | 1 | 10   | 3   | 1   | 1 |
| user data   | 0x00000000 | 1 | 0xfffff | 1 | 2    | 3   | 1   | 1 |
| kernel code | 0x00000000 | 1 | 0xfffff | 1 | 10   | 0   | 1   | 1 |
| kernel data | 0x00000000 | 1 | 0xfffff | 1 | 2    | 0   | 1   | 1 |

The corresponding Segment Selectors are defined by the macros `__USER_CS`, `__USER_DS`, `__KERNEL_CS`, and `__KERNEL_DS`, respectively. To address the kernel code segment, for instance, the kernel just loads the value yielded by the `__KERNEL_CS` macro into the `cs` segmentation register.

相应的段选择器分别使用宏`__USER_CS`、`__USER_DS`、`__KERNEL_CS`和 `__KERNEL_DS`定义。比如，想要寻址内核代码段，内核只需把`__KERNEL_CS`产生的值加载到`cs`段寄存器即可。

Notice that the linear addresses associated with such segments all start at 0 and reach the addressing limit of 2^32 –1. This means that all processes, either in User Mode or in Kernel Mode, may use the same logical addresses.

注意，这些段相关的线性地址总是从0开始的，上限是`2^32 –1`。这意味着，不论是在用户态还是内核模式，所有的进程使用相同的逻辑地址。

Another important consequence of having all segments start at `0x00000000` is that in Linux, logical addresses coincide with linear addresses; that is, the value of the Offset field of a logical address always coincides with the value of the corresponding linear address.

Linux中，让所有的段都从`0x00000000`地址开始的结果就是，逻辑地址和线性地址一致；也就是说，逻辑地址的offset值总是和相应的线性地址的值一致。

As stated earlier, the Current Privilege Level of the CPU indicates whether the processor is in User or Kernel Mode and is specified by the `RPL` field of the Segment Selector stored in the `cs` register. Whenever the CPL is changed, some segmentation registers must be correspondingly updated. For instance, when the `CPL` is equal to 3 (User Mode), the `ds` register must contain the Segment Selector of the user data segment, but when the CPL is equal to 0, the `ds` register must contain the Segment Selector of the kernel data segment.

如前所述，CPU当前特权级别表示处理器是在用户态还是内核模式，其由存储在`cs`段寄存器中的段选择器中的`RPL`位域指定。无论什么时候CPL发生改变，都必须相应地更新段寄存器。例如，当`CPL=3`（用户态），`ds`寄存器必须包含的是用户数据段的段选择器，但是当`CPL=0`（内核模式），`ds`寄存器必须包含的是内核数据段的段选择器，

A similar situation occurs for the `ss` register. It must refer to a User Mode stack inside the user data segment when the CPL is 3, and it must refer to a Kernel Mode stack inside the kernel data segment when the CPL is 0. When switching from User Mode to Kernel Mode, Linux always makes sure that the `ss` register contains the Segment Selector of the kernel data segment.

`ss`寄存器的情况也差不多。当PCL=3时，它必须指向用户数据段中的用户态的栈；当CPL=0时，它必须指向内核数据段中的内核模式的栈。当从用户态切换到内核模式时，Linux总是保证`ss`寄存器保存的是内核数据段的段选择器。

When saving a pointer to an instruction or to a data structure, the kernel does not need to store the Segment Selector component of the logical address, because the `ss` register contains the current Segment Selector. As an example, when the kernel invokes a function, it executes a `call` assembly language instruction specifying just the Offset component of its logical address; the Segment Selector is implicitly selected as the one referred to by the `cs` register. Because there is just one segment of type “executable in Kernel Mode,” namely the code segment identified by `__KERNEL_CS`, it is sufficient to load `__KERNEL_CS` into `cs` whenever the CPU switches to Kernel Mode. The same argument goes for pointers to kernel data structures (implicitly using the `ds` register), as well as for pointers to user data structures (the kernel explicitly uses the `es` register).

当保存指向一条指令或一个数据结构的指针时，内核不需要存储逻辑地址中的段选择器部分，因为`ss`寄存器保存着当前的段选择器。比如，当内核调用一个函数时，它执行`call`汇编语言指令，仅仅指定它的逻辑地址的offset部分；段选择器隐含地选择`cs`寄存器引用的那个。因为在内核模式下只有一种可执行的代码段类型，使用`__KERNEL_CS`标识，所以当CPU切换到内核模式是，只需要把`__KERNEL_CS`载入`cs`寄存器就足够了。同理可得，指向内核数据结构的指针（内核隐式使用`ds`寄存器）和指向用户数据结构的指针（内核显式使用`es`寄存器）也是如此。

Besides the four segments just described, Linux makes use of a few other specialized segments. We’ll introduce them in the next section while describing the Linux GDT.

除了刚刚描述的4个段，Linux还利用了一些其它专用段，我们将在下一章描述Linux的GDT时描述它们。

<h3 id="2.3.1">2.3.1 Linux GDT</h3>

In uniprocessor systems there is only one GDT, while in multiprocessor systems there is one GDT for every CPU in the system. All GDTs are stored in the `cpu_gdt_table` array, while the addresses and sizes of the GDTs (used when initializing the `gdtr` registers) are stored in the `pu_gdt_descr` array. If you look in the Source Code Index, you can see that these symbols are defined in the file `arch/i386/kernel/head.S`. Every macro, function, and other symbol in this book is listed in the Source Code Index, so you can quickly find it in the source code.

单核系统只有一个GDT，而多核系统中每一个CPU都有一个GDT。所有的GDT存储在`cpu_gdt_table`数组中，而各个GDT的地址和大小（初始化`gdtr`寄存器时使用）存储在`cpu_gdt_descr`数组中。如果查看附录中的源代码索引，会发现这些符号的定义位于文件`arch/i386/kernel/head.S`中。本书中所有的宏、函数和其它符号都可以在附录中的源代码索引中找到。

The layout of the GDTs is shown schematically in Figure 2-6. Each GDT includes 18 segment descriptors and 14 null, unused, or reserved entries. Unused entries are inserted on purpose so that Segment Descriptors usually accessed together are kept in the same 32-byte line of the hardware cache (see the section “Hardware Cache” later in this chapter).

GDT的布局可以参考图2-6.每一个GDT包含18个段描述符和14个空、未使用和保留的项。之所以插入未使用的项是因为，段描述符通常在[硬件cache](#2.4.7)中是按照32字节的line一起访问的。

<img id="Figure_2-6" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_2_6.PNG">

图2-6 全局描述符表-GDT

这18个段描述符指向下面这些段：

*  4个用户和内核代码和数据段

* 任务状态段(TSS)，对于系统中的每个CPU都是不同的。TSS对应的线性地址空间仅仅是内核数据段对应的线性地址空间的一小部分。所有任务状态段(TSS)被连续地存储在init_tss寄存器中；第N个CPU的TSS描述符的Base位域指向init_tss数组的第N部分。G标志被置0，Limit位域被设置位0xeb，因为TSS段的大小就是236字节长；Type位域被设置为9或11（可用的32位TSS）；DPL被设置为0，因为用户态的进程不允许访问TSS段。将会在第3章的[任务状态段](#3.3.2)一节中详细讲解Linux如何使用TSS。

* 包含默认LDT的段，通常所有的进程共享（将在下一节中介绍）。

*  3个线程本地存储段（TLS）：这是一种允许多线程程序可以使用多达3个段保存每个线程本地数据的机制。系统调用set_thread_area()和get_thread_area()，分别为正在执行的进程创建和释放TLS段。

*  3个跟高级电源管理（APM）相关的段：BIOS代码使用这些段，所以，当Linux APM驱动调用BIOS函数去获取或设置APM设备的状态时，它可能会使用用户代码和数据段。

*  5个和即插即用（PnP)BIOS服务相关的段。和上一种段类似，BIOS代码使用这些段，所以当Linux PnP驱动调用BIOS函数检测PnP设备可用的资源时，可能会使用用户代码和数据段。

*  内核使用的一个特殊TSS段，用来处理（Double fault）异常（参见第4章的[异常](#4.2.2)一节）

As stated earlier, there is a copy of the GDT for each processor in the system. All copies of the GDT store identical entries, except for a few cases. First, each processor has its own TSS segment, thus the corresponding GDT’s entries differ. Moreover, a few entries in the GDT may depend on the process that the CPU is executing (LDT and TLS Segment Descriptors). Finally, in some cases a processor may temporarily modify an entry in its copy of the GDT; this happens, for instance, when invoking an APM’s BIOS procedure.

如前所述，系统中的每个处理器都有一份GDT。所有的GDT都存储相同的项，一些特殊情况除外。首先，每个处理器具有自己的TSS段，因此，相应的GDT项也会不同。更重要的是，GDT中的一些项还要依赖CPU正在执行的进程（LDT和TLS段描述符）。<font color="red"> 最后，在某些特殊情况下，处理器可以临时修改自己GDT中的项；比如，当调用一个APM的BIOS程序时，这就会发生。(TODO：目前不理解)</font>

<h3 id="2.3.2">2.3.2 Linux LDT</h3>

Most Linux User Mode applications do not make use of a Local Descriptor Table, thus the kernel defines a default LDT to be shared by most processes. The default Local Descriptor Table is stored in the `default_ldt` array. It includes five entries, but only two of them are effectively used by the kernel: a call gate for iBCS executables, and a call gate for Solaris/x86 executables (see the section “Execution Domains” in Chapter 20). Call gates are a mechanism provided by 80×86 microprocessors to change the privilege level of the CPU while invoking a predefined function; as we won’t discuss them further, you should consult the Intel documentation for more details.

许多用户态程序不使用LDT，因而内核定义了一个默认LDT，供大多数进程共享。默认的LDT存储在default_ldt数组中。它包含5项，但是只有2项被内核有效使用：一个用于iBCS可执行文件的调用门，另一个用于Solaris/x86可执行文件的调用门（参见第20章的[执行域](#20.3)一节）。调用门是由x86处理器提供的一种机制，用于调用预定义函数的同时，改变CPU的特权级别。我们先不深入讨论，更多的细节可以参考Intel文档。

In some cases, however, processes may require to set up their own LDT. This turns out to be useful to applications (such as Wine) that execute segment-oriented Microsoft Windows applications. The `modify_ldt()` system call allows a process to do this.

但是，某些情况下，进程需要建立自己的LDT。这对于面向分段的微软Windows应用程序（比如Wine）是非常有用的。系统调用modify_ldt()允许进程做这些。

Any custom LDT created by modify_ldt() also requires its own segment. When a processor starts executing a process having a custom LDT, the LDT entry in the CPU-specific copy of the GDT is changed accordingly.

任何由modify_ldt()创建的自定义LDT也需要它自己的段。当处理器开始执行一个拥有自定义的LDT的进程时，特定于CPU的GDT中的LDT项也应相应地更改。

User Mode applications also may allocate new segments by means of modify_ldt(); the kernel, however, never makes use of these segments, and it does not have to keep track of the corresponding Segment Descriptors, because they are included in the custom LDT of the process.

用户态程序也许会通过modify_ldt()分配新段；但是，内核绝不会利用这些段，也不会追踪这些段描述符，因为它们保存在进程的自定义LDT中。

<h2 id="2.4">2.4 内存分页</h2>

The paging unit translates linear addresses into physical ones. One key task in the unit is to check the requested access type against the access rights of the linear address. If the memory access is not valid, it generates a Page Fault exception (see Chapter 4 and Chapter 8).

分页单元将线性地址转换成物理地址。分页单元主要的任务就是根据线性地址的访问权限检查请求的访问类型。如果访问无效，则产生一个页错误异常（具体看[第4章](#4)和[第8章](#8)）。

For the sake of efficiency, linear addresses are grouped in fixed-length intervals called pages; contiguous linear addresses within a page are mapped into contiguous physical addresses. In this way, the kernel can specify the physical address and the access rights of a page instead of those of all the linear addresses included in it. Following the usual convention, we shall use the term “page” to refer both to a set of linear addresses and to the data contained in this group of addresses.

为了效率，将线性地址按照固定长度组织为页；一个页的连续线性地址映射为连续的物理地址。通过这种方式，内核可以按页指定物理地址和访问权限，而不是对整个内存地址进行操作，增加了灵活性。基于传统习惯，我们使用 *page*这个词表示一组线性地址及其存储内容。

The paging unit thinks of all RAM as partitioned into fixed-length page frames (sometimes referred to as physical pages). Each page frame contains a page—that is, the length of a page frame coincides with that of a page. A page frame is a constituent of main memory, and hence it is a storage area. It is important to distinguish a page from a page frame; the former is just a block of data, which may be stored in any page frame or on disk.

分页单元把所有的RAM分为固定长度的`页帧`（有时，也称为物理页）。每一个页帧都包含一个页，也就是说，页帧的长度和页的长度是一致的。页帧是内存的组成部分，是指一段存储区域。弄清楚`页`和`页帧`这两个概念是非常重要的；前者是一块数据，可能存储在任何页帧或硬盘上。

The data structures that map linear to physical addresses are called page tables; they are stored in main memory and must be properly initialized by the kernel before enabling the paging unit.

映射线性地址到物理地址的数据结构，称为页表；它们存储在内存中，使能分页单元之前必须被正确初始化。

Starting with the 80386, all 80×86 processors support paging; it is enabled by setting the PG flag of a control register named cr0. When PG = 0, linear addresses are interpreted as physical addresses.

从80386架构开始，所有的x86架构处理器都支持分页机制；通过控制寄存器cr0的PG标志位进行设置。当PG=0，线性地址就是物理地址。

> <font color="red">注：</font>
> <font color="red">也就是分段机制已经被废弃了，所以暂时不深究了。</font>

<h3 id="2.4.1">2.4.1 常规分页</h3>

Starting with the 80386, the paging unit of Intel processors handles 4 KB pages. The 32 bits of a linear address are divided into three fields:

从80386架构开始，英特尔的分页单元将页的大小划分为4KB。32位的线性地址被分为3个域：

* 目录 - 最高有效10位

* 表 - 中间10位

* 偏移量 - 最低有效12位

The translation of linear addresses is accomplished in two steps, each based on a type of translation table. The first translation table is called the Page Directory, and the second is called the Page Table.

线性地址的转换分为2步，每一步都依赖一个转换表。第一级转换表称为`页目录`，第二级称为`页表`。

> 在后面的讨论中，小写的`page table`表示存储着线性地址和物理地址映射关系的任何页，而大写的`Page Table`术语表示最后一级页表中的页。

The aim of this two-level scheme is to reduce the amount of RAM required for perprocess Page Tables. If a simple one-level Page Table was used, then it would require up to 2^20 entries (i.e., at 4 bytes per entry, 4 MB of RAM) to represent the Page Table for each process (if the process used a full 4 GB linear address space), even though a process does not use all addresses in that range. The two-level scheme reduces the memory by requiring Page Tables only for those virtual memory regions actually used by a process.

2级页表的方案的目的是减少每个进程页表所占的RAM数量。如果只使用1级页表，为了按照4K大小的页访问，那就需要多达2^20项，每项占用4字节，需要4M的RAM，而且还有那么多进程，想想就很可怕。另外，即使一个进程不使用所有的线性地址空间，一级页表也还是这么大。这大大降低了RAM的实际使用率。而使用2级页表可以减少内存的使用，因为第二级页表只是进程实际使用的虚拟地址空间。（第二级页表是进程在创建的时候动态申请的）

Each active process must have a Page Directory assigned to it. However, there is no need to allocate RAM for all Page Tables of a process at once; it is more efficient to allocate RAM for a Page Table only when the process effectively needs it.

每个激活的进程必须有一个页目录。但是，无需为进程的所有二级页表都分配内存。只当进程需要某个二级页表的时候再给其分配内存，这样更有效率。

The physical address of the Page Directory in use is stored in a control register named cr3. The `Directory` field within the linear address determines the entry in the Page Directory that points to the proper Page Table. The address’s `Table` field, in turn, determines the entry in the Page Table that contains the physical address of the page frame containing the page. The `Offset` field determines the relative position within the page frame (see Figure 2-7). Because it is 12 bits long, each page consists of 4096 bytes of data.

页目录的物理地址被存储在控制寄存器`cr3`。线性地址中的Directory域决定了在页目录中的第几项，而该项的内容又指向恰当的二级页表。Table域，决定了在页表中的第几项，而该项的内容就是对应的页帧的物理地址。Offset域决定了在页帧中的相对位置（参考图2-7）。Offset域所占的长度是12位，正好是每页4096个字节的大小。

图2-7 80×86处理器分页框图

Both the `Directory` and the `Table` fields are 10 bits long, so Page Directories and Page Tables can include up to 1,024 entries. It follows that a Page Directory can address up to 1024 × 1024 × 4096=2^32 memory cells, as you’d expect in 32-bit addresses.

Directory和Table域的长度都是10位，所以所能寻址的项数都是1024项。结果就是，一个页目录可以寻址的大小为`1024 × 1024 × 4096=2^32`，正与期望的32位地址相同。

The entries of Page Directories and Page Tables have the same structure. Each entry includes the following fields:

页目录和页表中的项具有相同的结构。每一项包含下面这些内容：

* Present标志

    如果被设置，说明指向的页（或二级页表）被包含在内存中；如果该标志为0，内存中没有该页，该项中的其它位由操作系统作其它目的使用。如果需要执行地址转换的二级页表或页目录中的项中的`Present`标志被清除，分页单元就将该线性地址存储到控制寄存器`cr2`中并产生异常14-页错误异常。（我们将在[第17章 Linux如何使用该标志](#17)中看到。）

    <font color="blue"> 通俗地讲，使用该标志表示要访问的地址在内存中存不存在，不存在的话，就会产生页错误异常。</font>

* 包含页帧物理地址中最重要的20位的域

    因为每个页帧具有4KB的容量，它的物理地址肯定是4096的倍数，所以，所包含的物理地址的低12位总是0。如果该域是指向页目录的，页帧中包含的是一个页表；如果它指向一个页表，页帧中包含的是数据所在的页。

* 访问标志

    每次分页单元访问相应的页帧时，设置该标志。操作系统在选择要换出的页时，使用该标志。分页单元绝不会复位该标志，应该由操作系统完成。

* Dirty标志

    只对页表项有用。每次对页帧实行写操作的时候，设置该标志。因为和Accessed标志一样，也是操作系统在选择要换出的页时使用该标志。分页单元绝不会复位该标志，应该由操作系统完成。

* Read/Write标志

    页或页表的访问权限（读写、只读）。具体参考本章后面的[硬件保护机制](#2.4.3)。

* User/Supervisor标志

    访问页或页表所需要的特权级别。具体参考本章后面的[硬件保护机制](#2.4.3)。

* PCD和PWT标志

    控制硬件Cache处理页或页表的方式。具体参考本章后面的[硬件Cache](#2.4.7)。

* 页大小标志

   只对页目录有效。如果被设置，每项指向2MB或4MB大小的页帧（后面会有介绍）。

* 全局标志

   只对页表项有用。这个标记是在Pentium Pro中引入的，用于防止频繁使用的页面从TLB缓存中被刷新(请参阅本章后面的[转换旁路缓存-TLB](#2.4.8)一节)。只有在设置了寄存器cr4的页全局使能(PGE)标志的情况下才能工作。


<h3 id="2.4.2">2.4.2 扩展分页</h3>

从奔腾系列开始，80×86架构处理器引入了扩展分页，允许页帧的大小为4M，从而代替4K（看图2-8）。扩展分页用来转换大段连续的线性地址到相应的物理内存。内核无需中间的二级页表即可以保存内存，且保护TLB中的项不被频繁的刷新。（参考后面的[转换旁路缓存-TLB](#2.4.8)一节）

<img id="Figure_2-8" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_2_8.PNG">

图2-8 扩展分页

正如前面提到的，通过设置页目录项中的页大小标志来使能扩展分页。这时，分页单元把32位线性地址分成2部分：

* 目录 - 最高有效10位

* 偏移量 - 剩下的22位

使能了扩展分页的页目录项和普通的分页几乎相同，除了：

* 必须设置`页大小`标志。
* 只有物理地址20位中的最高10位有效。这是因为低22位全被设为0。
* 扩展分页和常规分页共存。通过cr4寄存器中的PSE标志进行使能。

<h3 id="2.4.3">2.4.3 硬件保护</h3>

分页单元使用与分段单元不一样的保护机制。尽管80x86允许4个可能的特权级别访问一个段，但是分页机制只使用了2个特权级别访问页和页表，特别级别的设定已经在[常规分页](#2.4.1)中提到，使用`User/Supervisor`标志。当这个标志为0，页只能被CPL低于3的特权级别访问（对于Linux，这意味着处理器此时处于内核模式）；当该标志为1，总是可以访问页。

另外，代替分段机制时的三种访问权限（读、写、和执行），分页机制只有两种访问权限（读和写）。如果页目录或二级页表的读/写标志等于0，相应的二级页表或页是只读的；否则，可被读写。

<h3 id="2.4.4">2.4.4 常规分页的示例</h3>

我们使用一个简单的示例阐明常规分页的工作机理。假定内核分配线性地址0x20000000~0x2003ffff给正在运行的进程。这段地址实际是64个页。我们不关心页帧的物理地址；事实上，有些也有可能不在内存范围内。我们感兴趣的只是二级页表项的其余域。

我们从该线性地址的最高有效10位开始，它们被分页单元解释为页面目录域。该段地址以2开始，后面紧跟0，所以最高10位的值相同，都是0x080或128。所以，所有地址的目录域都指向该进程页表目录的第129项。该项中肯定包含分配给进程的二级页表的物理地址（如图2-9所示）。如果没有其它线性地址分配给进程，页目录其余的1023项都会被填充0。

<img id="Figure_2-9" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_2_9.PNG">

图2-9 常规分页示例

赋给中间10位的值，范围是0~0x03f，或者说0~63。也就是说，只有二级页表的前64项是合法的。其余的960项被填充0。

假设该进程想要读取线性地址0x20021406处的字节值。分页单元的处理过程如下：

1. 使用目录域的值0x80锁定页目录中的第0x80项，其中的内容指向该进程的页所对应的二级页表。

2. 页表域的值0x21用来锁定二级页表的第0x21项，它指向想要访问页的页帧。

3.最后使用偏移值0x406选择想要的页帧，在偏移量0x406处的值。

如果二级页表第0x21项的Present标志被清除，想要访问的地址所在页不在内存中。这时，分页单元发送一个页错误异常。如果进程想要访问地址0x20000000~0x2003ffff范围之外的地址，也会发生相同的页错误异常。上面提到二级页表的其余未用的项被填充0，尤其是，Present标志全被清除。

<h3 id="2.4.5">2.4.5 物理地址扩展(PAE)分页机制</h3>

处理器能够访问的RAM数量是受到总线宽度的影响的。从80386到奔腾系列，这些旧英特尔处理器都是使用32位物理地址。理论上，可以使用4GB的RAM；实际上，因为用户态进程的线性地址要求，内核不能直接寻址超过1GB的RAM，比如，在32位系统上，页上层目录和页中层目录被消除了，这将在[Linux分页机制](#2.5)中提到。

但是，大型服务器需要同时运行成千上万个进程，这往往要求RAM大于4GB。这就要求英特尔扩展32位80x86架构支持的RAM数量。

英特尔通过增加CPU的地址线，32位扩展到36位，来满足这个要求。从奔腾Pro开始，所有的英特尔处理器能够寻址2^36=64GB的RAM。但是，增加了物理地址的范围，也需要新分页硬件单元，完成将32位线性地址转换成36位的物理地址。

通过奔腾Pro处理器，英特尔引入一种机制，称为物理地址扩展（PAE）。奔腾III处理器还引入了另外一种机制，称为页大小扩展（PSE-36），但是Linux并没有使用，所以，我们不再介绍。

PAE可以通过设置cr4寄存器中PAE标志激活。页目录项中的页大小（PS）标志能够使能大页访问（PAE被使能时，是2M）。

为了支持PAE，英特尔改变了硬件分页单元：

* 64G的物理内存被分割成2^24个不同的页帧，页表项的物理地址域从20位扩展到24位。因为基于PAE的最后一级页表中的项必须是12位（前面的[常规分页](#2.4.1)中已经讲述过），再加上24位的物理地址，总位数达到36位，页表项的大小必须从32位扩展到64位才能满足要求。结果，4K页大小的PAE页表中包含512项而不是之前说的1024项。

* 多出来的一级页表称为页目录指针表（PDPT），包含4个64位的项。

* cr3寄存器控制27位页目录指针表基地址。因为PDPT存储在物理内存的第一个4G空间中，而且排列是32字节的倍数（2^5），所以27足够表达这个表的基地址了。

* 当最小寻址单元是4KB页大小时（页目录项中的PS标志被清除），32位的线性地址按照下面的方式解释：

    - cr3 - 指向一个PDPT

    - 位31–30 - 指向PDPT中四个可能项中的一个

    - 位29–21 - 指向页目录中的512项中的一个

    - 位20–12 - 指向页表中的512项中的一个

    - 位11–0 - 4K页中的偏移

* 当最小寻址单元是2MB页大小时（页目录项中的PS标志被设置），32位的线性地址按照下面的方式解释：

    - cr3 - 指向一个PDPT

    - 位31–30 - 指向PDPT中4项中的一个

    - 位29–21 - 指向页目录中的512项中的一个

    - 位20–0 - 2M页中的偏移

总之，一旦设置了cr3，可能的寻址范围达到4GB的RAM。如果我们想要寻址更大的RAM，我们必须改变cr3的值或者改变PDPT中的内容。但是，PAE的问题是，线性空间仍然是32位的。也就是说，每个进程最大的访问空间仍然是4G，这迫使编程者不断使用相同的线性地址访问不同的物理内存区域。我们将会在后面的段落中描述启用PAE，物理内存大于4G的情况下，Linux如何初始化页表。但是，PAE毕竟使内核可以利用的内存达到了64G，这可以显著增加系统中的进程数量。

<h3 id="2.4.6">2.4.6 64位架构分页机制</h3>

正如我们前面讲述的，32位系统通常使用2级页表。但是，2级页表对于采用64位架构的计算机却不合适。我们做一个假想性的实验来解释为什么：

假设标准页大小还是4KB。因为4KB覆盖2^12地址，所以`Offset`域为12位。这还剩余52位线性地址分配给`Table`和`Directory`域。如果只使用64位中的48位进行寻址（这样的话，可以有256TB的地址空间），剩余48-12=36位分配给`Table`和`Directory`域。如果我们给这2个域各保留18位，那么每个进程的页面目录和最后一级页表应该包含2^18项-也就是说，超过256000项。这太耗费内存了。

基于上面的原因，64位处理器都使用多级页表。具体依赖于处理器。表2-4总结了Linux支持的64位系统，它们的硬件分页单元的主要特性。

表2-4. 64位架构中的页表结构

| 平台名称 | 页大小 | 使用的地址位数 | 页表数量 | 线性地址分割 |
| -------- | ------ | -------------- | -------- | ------------ |

> *该架构支持不同的页大小，在这儿，我们选择Linux采用的典型大小。因为该架构已经不再研发，可以不研究。

在后面的[Linux的分页机制](#2.5)中我们会讲到，Linux设计了一个通用分页模型，适合大部分硬件系统。

<h3 id="2.4.7">2.4.7 硬件Cache</h3>

Today’s microprocessors have clock rates of several gigahertz, while dynamic RAM (DRAM) chips have access times in the range of hundreds of clock cycles. This means that the CPU may be held back considerably while executing instructions that require fetching operands from RAM and/or storing results into RAM.

今天，微处理器的时钟频率都是几GHz，但是DRAM的时钟频率却不能匹配。时钟频率的不匹配导致从RAM读取数据都会变慢，影响CPU指令的执行效率。

Hardware cache memories were introduced to reduce the speed mismatch between CPU and RAM. They are based on the well-known locality principle, which holds both for programs and data structures. This states that because of the cyclic structure of programs and the packing of related data into linear arrays, addresses close to the ones most recently used have a high probability of being used in the near future. It therefore makes sense to introduce a smaller and faster memory that contains the most recently used code and data. For this purpose, a new unit called the line was introduced into the 80×86 architecture. It consists of a few dozen contiguous bytes that are transferred in burst mode between the slow DRAM and the fast on-chip static RAM (SRAM) used to implement caches.

为了减少CPU和RAM之间的速度不匹配，引入了Cache。Cache的设计遵循局部性原理，由于程序的循环结构和相关数据一般保存成线型数组，接近最近使用的地址有很高的可能性接下来被使用。因此，引入一个小容量、读取速度快的内存，包含最近使用的代码和数据就很有意义。一种新的硬件单元被引入80x86架构，称为`line`。它包含几十个连续的字节，在慢速DRAM和Cache之间以快速模式传输，一般使用快速片上静态RAM（SRAM）实现Cache。

The cache is subdivided into subsets of lines. At one extreme, the cache can be direct mapped, in which case a line in main memory is always stored at the exact same location in the cache. At the other extreme, the cache is fully associative, meaning that any line in memory can be stored at any location in the cache. But most caches are to some degree N-way set associative, where any line of main memory can be stored in any one of N lines of the cache. For instance, a line of memory can be stored in two different lines of a two-way set associative cache.

Cache被分成若干行，通常称为`Cache line`或者`Cache行`。一种极端情况就是，Cache中的行和内存中的行是一一对应、直接映射的关系。另一种情况是，Cache是全相关的，意味着内存中的任何行可以存储到Cache中的任意行。但是，大部分Cache使用的是N路相关，内存中的任意行可以存储到Cache的N行中的任意一个。比如，一个2路相关的Cache中，内存的一行可以被存储到该Cache中的2个行中的任意一个。

As shown in Figure 2-10, the cache unit is inserted between the paging unit and the main memory. It includes both a hardware cache memory and a cache controller. The cache memory stores the actual lines of memory. The cache controller stores an array of entries, one entry for each line of the cache memory. Each entry includes a tag and a few flags that describe the status of the cache line. The tag consists of some bits that allow the cache controller to recognize the memory location currently mapped by the line. The bits of the memory’s physical address are usually split into three groups: the most significant ones correspond to the tag, the middle ones to the cache controller subset index, and the least significant ones to the offset within the line.

如果2-10所示，Cache硬件单元位于分页管理单元和主内存之间，包含一个Cache内存和Cache控制器。Cache内存用来存储来自主内存的实际行。Cache控制器存储着Cache内存中行数，一行对应一项，使用数组管理。每项包含一个TAG和描述Cache行状态的一些标志。TAG由一些位组成，这些位允许Cache控制器识别当前该行映射的内存位置。内存的物理地址位通常分为3组：最高的一些位对应TAG，中间的一些位对应Cache控制器的index，最低的那些位用来标识在行内的偏移量。

<img id="Figure_2-10" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_2_10.PNG">

图2-10 硬件cache

When accessing a RAM memory cell, the CPU extracts the subset index from the physical address and compares the tags of all lines in the subset with the high-order bits of the physical address. If a line with the same tag as the high-order bits of the address is found, the CPU has a `cache hit`; otherwise, it has a `cache miss`.

为了访问RAM内存单元，CPU从物理地址中抽取索引，将物理地址的高位（也就是表示TAG部分的位）与所有line的tag比较。如果找到和物理地址中标识TAG部分相同TAG的line，则称为Cache命中；否则称为Cache丢失。

When a cache hit occurs, the cache controller behaves differently, depending on the access type. For a read operation, the controller selects the data from the cache line and transfers it into a CPU register; the RAM is not accessed and the CPU saves time, which is why the cache system was invented. For a write operation, the controller may implement one of two basic strategies called write-through and write-back. In a write-through, the controller always writes into both RAM and the cache line, effectively switching off the cache for write operations. In a write-back, which offers more immediate efficiency, only the cache line is updated and the contents of the RAM are left unchanged. After a write-back, of course, the RAM must eventually be updated. The cache controller writes the cache line back into RAM only when the CPU executes an instruction requiring a flush of cache entries or when a FLUSH hardware signal occurs (usually after a cache miss).

当Cache命中时，Cache控制器对不同的访问类型表现的行为不一样。对于read操作，从Cache行中选择数据，并将其写入到CPU寄存器中；没有访问RAM，CPU节省了时间，这就是为什么Cache系统被发明的原因。对于write操作，控制器可能会执行两种操作write-through和write-back。在write-through中，控制器总是同时写RAM和Cache行，有效地关闭了用于写操作的Cache；而在write-back中，只更新Cache行，RAM中的内容暂时不更新，这有助于提高时间上的效率。当然了，Write-back操作之后，RAM最终还是要被更新。但是，只有当CPU执行刷新Cache的命令或者产生FLUSH硬件信号（通常发生Cache丢失之后）时，控制器才会将Cache行写回到RAM中。<font color="blue"> 所有的Cache行一起写，提高了写操作的效率（使用DMA访问方式）</font>

When a cache miss occurs, the cache line is written to memory, if necessary, and the correct line is fetched from RAM into the cache entry.

当Cache丢失时，如果需要的话，将Cache行写入内存，并从内存中获取正确的line写入到Cache对应的项中。

Multiprocessor systems have a separate hardware cache for every processor, and therefore they need additional hardware circuitry to synchronize the cache contents. As shown in Figure 2-11, each CPU has its own local hardware cache. But now updating becomes more time consuming: whenever a CPU modifies its hardware cache, it must check whether the same data is contained in the other hardware cache; if so, it must notify the other CPU to update it with the proper value. This activity is often called cache snooping. Luckily, all this is done at the hardware level and is of no concern to the kernel.

多处理器系统为每一个处理器提供一个cache，因此需要外部提供同步cache内容的硬件电路。如图2-11所示，每一个CPU都有自己局部的cache。这个更新增加了耗时：无论何时CPU修改了它的cache，它必须检查其它的cache是否包含相同的数据；如果是，它必须通知其它CPU更新为正确的值。这个操作称为Cache窥探。幸运的是，这些都是硬件完成的，内核无需关心。

> ARM架构类似的电路称为 *Snoop Control Unit-SCU*。

<img id="Figure_2-11" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_2_11.PNG">

图2-11 双核架构中的cache

Cache technology is rapidly evolving. For example, the first Pentium models included a single on-chip cache called the L1-cache. More recent models also include other larger, slower on-chip caches called the L2-cache, L3-cache, etc. The consistency between the cache levels is implemented at the hardware level. Linux ignores these hardware details and assumes there is a single cache.

The CD flag of the cr0 processor register is used to enable or disable the cache circuitry. The NW flag, in the same register, specifies whether the write-through or the write-back strategy is used for the caches.

Another interesting feature of the Pentium cache is that it lets an operating system associate a different cache management policy with each page frame. For this purpose, each Page Directory and each Page Table entry includes two flags: PCD (Page Cache Disable), which specifies whether the cache must be enabled or disabled while accessing data included in the page frame; and PWT (Page Write-Through), which specifies whether the write-back or the write-through strategy must be applied while writing data into the page frame. Linux clears the PCD and PWT flags of all Page Directory and Page Table entries; as a result, caching is enabled for all page frames, and the write-back strategy is always adopted for writing.

<h3 id="2.4.8">2.4.8 转换旁路缓存-TLB</h3>

Besides general-purpose hardware caches, 80×86 processors include another cache called Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLB) to speed up linear address translation. When a linear address is used for the first time, the corresponding physical address is computed through slow accesses to the Page Tables in RAM. The physical address is then stored in a TLB entry so that further references to the same linear address can be quickly translated.

In a multiprocessor system, each CPU has its own TLB, called the local TLB of the CPU. Contrary to the hardware cache, the corresponding entries of the TLB need not be synchronized, because processes running on the existing CPUs may associate the same linear address with different physical ones.

When the cr3 control register of a CPU is modified, the hardware automatically invalidates all entries of the local TLB, because a new set of page tables is in use and the TLBs are pointing to old data.

<h2 id="2.5">2.5 Linux中的分页机制</h2>

Linux adopts a common paging model that fits both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. As explained in the earlier section “Paging for 64-bit Architectures,” two paging levels are sufficient for 32-bit architectures, while 64-bit architectures require a higher number of paging levels. Up to version 2.6.10, the Linux paging model consisted of three paging levels. Starting with version 2.6.11, a four-level paging model has been adopted.* The four types of page tables illustrated in Figure 2-12 are called:

Linux采用了适用于32位和64位架构的通用分页模型。正如在之前的[64位架构分页](#2.4.6)所解释的那样，2级页表对于32位系统而言足够了，而64位系统架构要求更多数量的分级页表。版本2.6.11之前，Linux分页模型由3级页表组成；从2.6.11开始，采用4级页表模型。如图2-12所示，它们分别称为：

* 页全局目录
* 页上层目录
* 页中间目录
* 最后一级页表

The Page Global Directory includes the addresses of several Page Upper Directories, which in turn include the addresses of several Page Middle Directories, which in turn include the addresses of several Page Tables. Each Page Table entry points to a page frame. Thus the linear address can be split into up to five parts. Figure 2-12 does not show the bit numbers, because the size of each part depends on the computer architecture.

页全局目录包含页上层目录的地址，这些地址又包含页中层目录的地址，这些页中间目录又包含几个页表，而每个页表又指向一个页帧。也就是说，线性地址被分割成5部分。图2-12没有展示这些位，因为每个部分的大小依赖于计算机的架构。

<img id="Figure_2-12" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_2_12.PNG">

图2-12 linux分页模型

For 32-bit architectures with no Physical Address Extension, two paging levels are sufficient. Linux essentially eliminates the Page Upper Directory and the Page Middle Directory fields by saying that they contain zero bits. However, the positions of the Page Upper Directory and the Page Middle Directory in the sequence of pointers are kept so that the same code can work on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. The kernel keeps a position for the Page Upper Directory and the Page Middle Directory by setting the number of entries in them to 1 and mapping these two entries into the proper entry of the Page Global Directory.

对于没有进行PAE物理地址扩展的32位架构来说，2级页表足够了。Linux通过填充0，把页上层目录和页中间目录域给消除了。但本质上，页上层目录和页中间目录还是存在的，所以在32位和64位架构上能运行相同的代码。内核通过设置页上层目录和页中间目录中的项数为1，将其位置保留，并将其映射到页全局目录中。

For 32-bit architectures with the Physical Address Extension enabled, three paging levels are used. The Linux’s Page Global Directory corresponds to the 80 × 86’s Page Directory Pointer Table, the Page Upper Directory is eliminated, the Page Middle Directory corresponds to the 80 × 86’s Page Directory, and the Linux’s Page Table corresponds to the 80 × 86’s Page Table.

对于使能了PAE扩展内存的32位系统，则是使用3级页表结构。Linux的页全局目录对应于80x86的页目录指针表，页上层目录被消除，页中间目录对应80x86的页目录，Linux的页表对应于80x86的页表。

Finally, for 64-bit architectures three or four levels of paging are used depending on the linear address bit splitting performed by the hardware (see Table 2-4).

最后，对于64位架构来说，使用3级页表结构还是4级页表结构，完全依赖于硬件将线性地址分割成几部分。（参见表2-4）

Linux’s handling of processes relies heavily on paging. In fact, the automatic translation of linear addresses into physical ones makes the following design objectives feasible:

Linux对进程的处理严重依赖于分页单元。事实上，将线性地址自动转换成物理地址，使下面的目标成为可能：

* Assign a different physical address space to each process, ensuring an efficient protection against addressing errors.

    为每个进程分配不同的物理地址空间，确保有效地防止寻址错误。

* Distinguish pages (groups of data) from page frames (physical addresses in main memory). This allows the same page to be stored in a page frame, then saved to disk and later reloaded in a different page frame. This is the basic ingredient of the virtual memory mechanism (see Chapter 17).

    区分页（数据）和页帧（内存中的物理地址）。这保证了相同的页被保存在同一个页帧中，然后再写入硬盘中，而后可以再加载到不同的页帧中。这是虚拟物理内存的基本构成要素。（参见[第17章](#17)）

In the remaining part of this chapter, we will refer for the sake of concreteness to the paging circuitry used by the 80 × 86 processors.

在本章的其余部分，为了具体起见，我们将提到80×86处理器使用的分页硬件单元。

As we will see in Chapter 9, each process has its own Page Global Directory and its own set of Page Tables. When a process switch occurs (see the section “Process Switch” in Chapter 3), Linux saves the `cr3` control register in the descriptor of the process previously in execution and then loads `cr3` with the value stored in the descriptor of the process to be executed next. Thus, when the new process resumes its execution on the CPU, the paging unit refers to the correct set of Page Tables.

正如我们将在[第9章](#9)中看到的，每个进程拥有自己的页全局目录和一组页表。当发生进程切换时，Linux保存cr3控制寄存器，其存储在先前执行的进程描述符中；然后把下一个要执行的进程的描述符的值存入cr3寄存器中。然后，新进程继续在CPU上执行，分页单元指向正确的页表。

Mapping linear to physical addresses now becomes a mechanical task, although it is still somewhat complex. The next few sections of this chapter are a rather tedious list of functions and macros that retrieve information the kernel needs to find addresses and manage the tables; most of the functions are one or two lines long. You may want to only skim these sections now, but it is useful to know the role of these functions and macros, because you’ll see them often in discussions throughout this book.

尽管分页机制很复杂，但是将线性地址映射成物理地址现在变成了一个硬件任务，无需我们操心。我们需要关心的是，如何检索内核查找地址所需的信息，如何操作这些页表。本节后面的部分介绍了这些函数和宏。

<h3 id="2.5.1">2.5.1 线性地址域</h3>

下面的宏简化了页表的处理：

* PAGE_SHIFT

    指定`Offset`域的长度，也就是位数。对于80x86处理器，该宏的值是12。因为一个页中的所有地址必须用`Offset`域能够索引到，所以页的大小就是2^12，也就是4096个字节。PAGE_SIZE会使用该宏返回一个页的大小。PAGE_MASK是0xfffff000，作为`Offset`域的掩码。

* PMD_SHIFT

    线性地址`Offset`和`Table`域的位的总长度；换句话说，页中间目录项能够映射的区域的大小。PMD_SIZE宏使用该宏计算出页中间目录项映射区域的大小，也就是一个页表的大小。PMD_MASK宏是`Offset`和`Table`域的掩码。

    当PAE禁止时，PMD_SHIFT的值是22（12位的`Offset`和10位的`Table`），PMD_SIZE产生的大小是2^22或4MB，PMD_MASK的值是0xffc00000。相反，如果PAE被使能，PMD_SHIFT的值是21（12位的`Offset`和9位的`Table`），PMD_SIZE产生的大小是2^21或2MB，PMD_MASK的值是0xffe00000。

    大页不使用最后一级页表，LARGE_PAGE_SIZE是大页的大小，等于PMD_SIZE(2PMD_SHIFT)，同时，LARGE_PAGE_MASK等于PMD_MASK

* PUD_SHIFT

    确定页上层目录项可以映射的区域大小的对数。PUD_SIZE计算页上层目录中的一项可以映射的区域大小。PUD_MASK是`Table`、`Offset`、`Middle Air`3个域的位掩码。在80x86系统上，PUD_SHIFT总是等于PMD_SHIFT，而PUD_SIZE等于4M或2M。

* PGDIR_SHIFT

    确定页全局目录项能够映射的区域大小的对数。PGDIR_SIZE计算一个页全局目录项映射区域的大小。PGDIR_MASK是对应位`Offset`、`Table`、`Middle Air`和`Upper Air` 域的位掩码。

    当PAE禁止时，PGDIR_SHIFT 的值是22（12位的`Offset`和10位的`Table`），PGDIR_SIZE 产生的大小是2^22或4MB，PGDIR_MASK的值是0xffc00000。相反，如果PAE被使能，PGDIR_SHIFT的值是30（12位的`Offset`+9位的`Table`+9位的`Middle Air`），PGDIR_SIZE产生的大小是2^30或1GB，PGDIR_MASK的值是0xc0000000。

* PTRS_PER_PTE、PTRS_PER_PMD、PTRS_PER_PUD和PTRS_PER_PGD

    分别计算各个表中的项数。当PAE禁止时，分别是1024、1、1和1024当PAE使能时，分别是512、512、1和4。

<h3 id="2.5.2">2.5.2 处理页表的相关函数</h3>

pte_t, pmd_t, pud_t, and pgd_t describe the format of, respectively, a Page Table, a Page Middle Directory, a Page Upper Directory, and a Page Global Directory entry. They are 64-bit data types when PAE is enabled and 32-bit data types otherwise. pgprot_t is another 64-bit (PAE enabled) or 32-bit (PAE disabled) data type that represents the protection flags associated with a single entry.

页表、页中间目录、页上层目录和页全局目录项分别由pte_t、pmd_t、pud_t和pgd_t这些结构体表示。当PAE功能使能时，它们都是64位数据类型，否则是32位数据类型。pgprot_t是另一种数据类型，PAE使能时是64位，禁止时是32位，这个数据类型用来表示一个页表或目录项相关的保护标志。

Five type-conversion macros—__pte, __pmd, __pud, __pgd, and __pgprot—cast an unsigned integer into the required type. Five other type-conversion macros—pte_val, pmd_val, pud_val, pgd_val, and pgprot_val—perform the reverse casting from one of the four previously mentioned specialized types into an unsigned integer.

Linux提供了5中类型转换宏工具，`__pte`、`__pmd`、`__pud`、`__pgd`和`__pgprot`，可以将无符号整形转换成想要的类型。还提供了五个相反方向的类型换换函数`pte_val`、`pmd_val`、`pud_val`、`pgd_val`和`pgprot_val`，将上面提到的四种特殊类型转换成无符号整数。

The kernel also provides several macros and functions to read or modify page table entries:

内核提供了一些宏和函数去读取或修改页表项：

* pte_none, pmd_none, pud_none, and pgd_none yield the value 1 if the corresponding entry has the value 0; otherwise, they yield the value 0.

* pte_clear, pmd_clear, pud_clear, and pgd_clear clear an entry of the corresponding page table, thus forbidding a process to use the linear addresses mapped by the page table entry. The ptep_get_and_clear() function clears a Page Table entry and returns the previous value.

* set_pte, set_pmd, set_pud, and set_pgd write a given value into a page table entry; set_pte_atomic is identical to set_pte, but when PAE is enabled it also ensures that the 64-bit value is written atomically.

* pte_same(a,b) returns 1 if two Page Table entries a and b refer to the same page and specify the same access privileges, 0 otherwise.

* pmd_large(e) returns 1 if the Page Middle Directory entry e refers to a large page (2 MB or 4 MB), 0 otherwise.

The pmd_bad macro is used by functions to check Page Middle Directory entries passed as input parameters. It yields the value 1 if the entry points to a bad Page Table—that is, if at least one of the following conditions applies:

* The page is not in main memory (Present flag cleared).
* The page allows only Read access (Read/Write flag cleared).
* Either Accessed or Dirty is cleared (Linux always forces these flags to be set for every existing Page Table).

The pud_bad and pgd_bad macros always yield 0. No pte_bad macro is defined, because it is legal for a Page Table entry to refer to a page that is not present in main memory, not writable, or not accessible at all.

The pte_present macro yields the value 1 if either the Present flag or the Page Size flag of a Page Table entry is equal to 1, the value 0 otherwise. Recall that the Page Size flag in Page Table entries has no meaning for the paging unit of the microprocessor; the kernel, however, marks Present equal to 0 and Page Size equal to 1 for the pages present in main memory but without read, write, or execute privileges. In this way, any access to such pages triggers a Page Fault exception because Present is cleared, and the kernel can detect that the fault is not due to a missing page by checking the value of Page Size.

The pmd_present macro yields the value 1 if the Present flag of the corresponding entry is equal to 1—that is, if the corresponding page or Page Table is loaded in main memory. The pud_present and pgd_present macros always yield the value 1.

The functions listed in Table 2-5 query the current value of any of the flags included in a Page Table entry; with the exception of pte_file(), these functions work properly only on Page Table entries for which pte_present returns 1.

表2-5. 页标志读取函数

| 函数名称      | 描述        |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| pte_user()    | Reads the User/Supervisor flag |
| pte_read()    | Reads the User/Supervisor flag (pages on the 80×86 processor cannot be protected against reading) |
| pte_write()   | Reads the Read/Write flag |
| pte_exec()    | Reads the User/Supervisor flag (pages on the 80x86 processor cannot be protected against code execution) |
| pte_dirty()   | Reads the Dirty flag |
| pte_young()   | Reads the Accessed flag |
| pte_file()    | Reads the Dirty flag (when the Present flag is cleared and the Dirty flag is set, the page belongs to a non-linear disk file mapping; see Chapter 16) |

Another group of functions listed in Table 2-6 sets the value of the flags in a Page Table entry.

表2-6. 页标志设置函数

| 函数名称      | 描述        |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| mk_pte_huge()      | 设置页表项中的Page Size和 Present标志 |
| pte_wrprotect()    | 清除读写标志 |
| pte_rdprotect()    | 清除User/Supervisor标志 |
| pte_exprotect()    | 清除User/Supervisor标志 |
| pte_mkwrite()      | 设置Read/Write标志 |
| pte_mkread()       | 设置User/Supervisor标志 |
| pte_mkexec()       | 设置User/Supervisor标志 |
| pte_mkclean()      | 清除Dirty标志 |
| pte_mkdirty()      | 设置Dirty标志 |
| pte_mkold()        | 清除Accessed标志(使该页变旧) |
| pte_mkyoung()      | 设置Accessed标志(使该页变年轻) |
| pte_modify(p,v)    | 设置页表项p为指定的值v |
| ptep_set_wrprotect()    | 同pte_wrprotect()，但是操作对象是指向页表项的指针 |
| ptep_set_access_flags() | 如果Dirty标志被设置, 设置一个页的访问权限为指定值并调用 flush_tlb_page() （参考[转换旁路缓存-TLB](#2.4.8)） |
| ptep_mkdirty()                | 同pte_mkdirty()，但是操作对象是指向页表项的指针 |
| ptep_test_and_clear_dirty()   | 同pte_mkclean()但是操作对象是指向页表项的指针并返回该标志旧值 |
| ptep_test_and_clear_young()   | 同pte_mkold()但是操作对象是指向页表项的指针并返回该标志旧值 |

Now, let’s discuss the macros listed in Table 2-7 that combine a page address and a group of protection flags into a page table entry or perform the reverse operation of extracting the page address from a page table entry. Notice that some of these macros refer to a page through the linear address of its “page descriptor” (see the section “Page Descriptors” in Chapter 8) rather than the linear address of the page itself.

Table 2-7. Macros acting on Page Table entries

| 函数名称      | 描述        |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| pgd_index(addr) | Yields the index (relative position) of the entry in the Page Global Directory that maps the linear address addr. |
| pgd_offset(mm, addr) | Receives as parameters the address of a memory descriptor cw (see Chapter 9) and a linear address addr. The macro yields the linear address of the entry in a Page Global Directory that corresponds to the address addr; the Page Global Directory is found through a pointer within the memory descriptor. |
| pgd_offset_k(addr) | Yields the linear address of the entry in the master kernel Page Global Directory that corresponds to the address addr (see the later section “Kernel Page Tables”). |
| pgd_page(pgd) | Yields the page descriptor address of the page frame containing the Page Upper Directory referred to by the Page Global Directory entry pgd. In a twoor three-level paging system, this macro is equivalent to pud_page() applied to the folded Page Upper Directory entry. |
| pud_offset(pgd, addr) | Receives as parameters a pointer pgd to a Page Global Directory entry and a linear address addr. The macro yields the linear address of the entry in a Page Upper Directory that corresponds to addr. In a two- or three-level paging system, this macro yields pgd, the address of a Page Global Directory entry. |
| pud_page(pud) | Yields the linear address of the Page Middle Directory referred to by the Page Upper Directory entry pud. In a two-level paging system, this macro is equivalent to pmd_page() applied to the folded Page Middle Directory entry. |
| pmd_index(addr) | Yields the index (relative position) of the entry in the Page Middle Directory that maps the linear address addr. |
| pmd_offset(pud, addr) | Receives as parameters a pointer pud to a Page Upper Directory entry and a linear address addr. The macro yields the address of the entry in a Page Middle Directory that corresponds to addr. In a two-level paging system, it yields pud, the address of a Page Global Directory entry. |
| pmd_page(pmd) | Yields the page descriptor address of the Page Table referred to by the Page Middle Directory entry pmd. In a two-level paging system, pmd is actually an entry of a Page Global Directory. |
| mk_pte(p,prot) | Receives as parameters the address of a page descriptor p and a group of access rights prot, and builds the corresponding Page Table entry. |
| pte_index(addr) | Yields the index (relative position) of the entry in the Page Table that maps the linear address addr. |
| pte_offset_kernel(dir, addr) | Yields the linear address of the Page Table that corresponds to the linear address addr mapped by the Page Middle Directory dir. Used only on the master kernel page tables (see the later section “Kernel Page Tables”). |
| pte_offset_map(dir, addr) | Receives as parameters a pointer dir to a Page Middle Directory entry and a linear address addr; it yields the linear address of the entry in the Page Table that corresponds to the linear address addr. If the Page Table is kept in high memory, the kernel establishes a temporary kernel mapping (see the section “Kernel Mappings of High-Memory Page Frames” in Chapter 8), to be released by means of pte_unmap. The macros pte_offset_map_nested and pte_unmap_nested are identical, but they use a different temporary kernel mapping. |
| pte_page(x) | Returns the page descriptor address of the page referenced by the Page Table entry x. |
| pte_to_pgoff(pte) | Extracts from the content pte of a Page Table entry the file offset corresponding to a page belonging to a non-linear file memory mapping (see the section “Non-Linear Memory Mappings” in Chapter 16). |
| pgoff_to_pte(offset) | Sets up the content of a Page Table entry for a page belonging to a non-linear file memory mapping. |

The last group of functions of this long list was introduced to simplify the creation and deletion of page table entries.

When two-level paging is used, creating or deleting a Page Middle Directory entry is trivial. As we explained earlier in this section, the Page Middle Directory contains a single entry that points to the subordinate Page Table. Thus, the Page Middle Directory entry is the entry within the Page Global Directory, too. When dealing with Page Tables, however, creating an entry may be more complex, because the Page Table that is supposed to contain it might not exist. In such cases, it is necessary to allocate a new page frame, fill it with zeros, and add the entry.

If PAE is enabled, the kernel uses three-level paging. When the kernel creates a new Page Global Directory, it also allocates the four corresponding Page Middle Directories; these are freed only when the parent Page Global Directory is released.

When two or three-level paging is used, the Page Upper Directory entry is always mapped as a single entry within the Page Global Directory.

As usual, the description of the functions listed in Table 2-8 refers to the 80×86 architecture.

Table 2-8. Page allocation functions

| 函数名称      | 描述        |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| pgd_alloc(mm) | Allocates a new Page Global Directory; if PAE is enabled, it also allocates the three children Page Middle Directories that map the User Mode linear addresses. The argument mm (the address of a memory descriptor) is ignored  on the 80x86 architecture. |
| pgd_free( pgd) | Releases the Page Global Directory at address pgd; if PAE is enabled, it also releases the three Page Middle Directories that map the User Mode linear addresses. |
| pud_alloc(mm, pgd, addr) | In a two- or three-level paging system, this function does nothing: it simply returns the linear address of the Page Global Directory entry pgd. |
| pud_free(x) | In a two- or three-level paging system, this macro does nothing. |
| pmd_alloc(mm, pud, addr) | Defined so generic three-level paging systems can allocate a new Page Middle Directory for the linear address addr. If PAE is not enabled, the function simply returns the input parameter pud—that is, the address of the entry in the Page Global Directory. If PAE is enabled, the function returns the linear address of the Page Middle Directory entry that maps the linear address addr. The argument cw is ignored. |
| pmd_free(x ) | Does nothing, because Page Middle Directories are allocated and deallocated together with their parent Page Global Directory. |
| pte_alloc_map(mm, pmd, addr) | Receives as parameters the address of a Page Middle Directory entry pmd and a linear address addr, and returns the address of the Page Table entry corresponding to addr. If the Page Middle Directory entry is null, the function allocates a new Page Table by invoking pte_alloc_one(). If a new Page Table is allocated, the entry corresponding to addr is initialized and the User/Supervisor flag is set. If the Page Table is kept in high memory, the kernel establishes a temporary kernel mapping (see the section “Kernel Mappings of High-Memory Page Frames” in Chapter 8), to be released by pte_unmap. |
| pte_alloc_kernel(mm, pmd, addr) | If the Page Middle Directory entry pmd associated with the address addr is null, the function allocates a new Page Table. It then returns the linear address of the Page Table entry associated with addr. Used only for master kernel page tables (see the later section “Kernel Page Tables”). |
| pte_free( pte) | Releases the Page Table associated with the pte page descriptor pointer. |
| pte_free_kernel(pte) | Equivalent to pte_free(), but used for master kernel page tables. |
| clear_page_range(mmu,start,end) | Clears the contents of the page tables of a process from linear address start to end by iteratively releasing its Page Tables and clearing the Page Middle Directory entries. |

<h3 id="2.5.3">2.5.3 物理内存布局</h3>

During the initialization phase the kernel must build a physical addresses map that specifies which physical address ranges are usable by the kernel and which are unavailable (either because they map hardware devices’ I/O shared memory or because the corresponding page frames contain BIOS data).

在初始化阶段，内核必须构建一个物理地址映射，指定哪些物理地址空间是内核可用的，哪些不可用（因为它们映射到I/O设备的共享内存，或者是保存BIOS数据的页帧）。

The kernel considers the following page frames as reserved:

内核将下列页帧视作保留：

* 可用物理地址范围之外的页帧
* 包含内核代码和初始化数据的页帧

A page contained in a reserved page frame can never be dynamically assigned or swapped to disk.

在保留页帧中的页永远不能动态分配或交换到硬盘中。

As a general rule, the Linux kernel is installed in RAM starting from the physical address 0x00100000—i.e., from the second megabyte. The total number of page frames required depends on how the kernel is configured. A typical configuration yields a kernel that can be loaded in less than 3 MB of RAM.

一般来说，Linux内核一般从内存的地址0x00100000处开始，也就是说，保留了1MB的空间。具体需要的页帧数量取决于内核大小。通常，内核不大于3M。

Why isn’t the kernel loaded starting with the first available megabyte of RAM? Well, the PC architecture has several peculiarities that must be taken into account. For example:

为什么内核保留1MB的空间呢？PC架构一些特性需要被考虑。比如：

* Page frame 0 is used by BIOS to store the system hardware configuration detected during the Power-On Self-Test (POST); the BIOS of many laptops, moreover, writes data on this page frame even after the system is initialized.

    页帧0是BIOS用来存储开机自检（Power-On Self-Test (POST)）时检测到的系统硬件配置的。更重要的是，很多笔记本电脑即使在初始化完成后，也会将数据写入这个页帧。

* Physical addresses ranging from 0x000a0000 to 0x000fffff are usually reserved to BIOS routines and to map the internal memory of ISA graphics cards. This area is the well-known hole from 640 KB to 1 MB in all IBM-compatible PCs: the physical addresses exist but they are reserved, and the corresponding page frames cannot be used by the operating system.

    物理地址0x000a0000到0x000fffff保留给BIOS服务程序的，用来映射ISA显卡的内部内存。这个区域是所有IBM兼容的PC中一个众所周知的保留区域，640K到1M地址范围：物理地址存在，但是保留，操作系统不能使用相关的页帧。

* Additional page frames within the first megabyte may be reserved by specificcomputer models. For example, the IBM ThinkPad maps the 0xa0 page frame into the 0x9f one.

    第一个1M内存中的其它页帧，可能被其它计算机架构保留。比如，IBM的ThinkPad将0xa0页帧映射到0x9f处。

In the early stage of the boot sequence (see Appendix A), the kernel queries the BIOS and learns the size of the physical memory. In recent computers, the kernel also invokes a BIOS procedure to build a list of physical address ranges and their corresponding memory types.

在早期的系统引导（boot）中，内核查询BIOS并了解物理内存的大小。在最近的计算机中，内核调用BIOS处理程序构建一个物理地址范围和它们相应内存类型的列表。

Later, the kernel executes the machine_specific_memory_setup() function, which builds the physical addresses map (see Table 2-9 for an example). Of course, the kernel builds this table on the basis of the BIOS list, if this is available; otherwise the kernel builds the table following the conservative default setup: all page frames with numbers from 0x9f (LOWMEMSIZE()) to 0x100 (HIGH_MEMORY) are marked as reserved.

稍后，内核执行`machine_specific_memory_setup()`函数，构建物理地址映射（参见表2-9）。当然了，如果BIOS列表可用，内核将以这个列表为基础构建这个映射表；否则，内核使用默认设置构建映射表：从0x9f（LOWMEMSIZE()）到0x100（HIGH_MEMORY()）被标记为保留。

表2-9. BIOS提供的物理地址映射的示例

| Start      | End        | Type   |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 0x00000000 | 0x0009FFFF | Usable |
| 0x000F0000 | 0x000FFFFF | Reserved |
| 0x00100000 | 0x07FEFFFF | Usable |
| 0x07FF0000 | 0x07FF2FFF | ACPI data |
| 0x07FF3000 | 0x07FFFFFF | ACPI NVS |
| 0xFFFF0000 | 0xFFFFFFFF | Reserved |

A typical configuration for a computer having 128 MB of RAM is shown in Table 2-9. The physical address range from `0x07ff0000` to `0x07ff2fff` stores information about the hardware devices of the system written by the BIOS in the POST phase; during the initialization phase, the kernel copies such information in a suitable kernel data structure, and then considers these page frames usable. Conversely, the physical address range of `0x07ff3000` to `0x07ffffff` is mapped to ROM chips of the hardware devices. The physical address range starting from `0xffff0000` is marked as reserved, because it is mapped by the hardware to the BIOS’s ROM chip (see Appendix A). Notice that the BIOS may not provide information for some physical address ranges (in the table, the range is 0x000a0000 to 0x000effff). To be on the safe side, Linux assumes that such ranges are not usable.

具有128M内存的计算机，典型的内存布局如表2-9所示。具有128 MB RAM的计算机的典型配置如表2-9所示。物理地址范围从0x07ff0000到0x07ff2fff，它存储有关BIOS在POST阶段写入的系统硬件设备的信息;在初始化阶段，内核将这些信息复制到合适的内核数据结构中，并认为这些页帧是可用的。相反，从0x07ff3000到0x07ffffff的物理地址范围映射到硬件设备的ROM芯片。从0xffff0000开始的物理地址范围被标记为保留的，因为它被硬件映射到BIOS的ROM芯片(参见附录A)。在该表中，由于BIOS没有提供0x000a0000到0x000effff的信息，为了安全起见，Linux假定这些地址空间是不可用的。

The kernel might not see all physical memory reported by the BIOS: for instance, the kernel can address only 4 GB of RAM if it has not been compiled with PAE support, even if a larger amount of physical memory is actually available. The `setup_memory()` function is invoked right after `machine_specific_memory_setup()`: it analyzes the table of physical memory regions and initializes a few variables that describe the kernel’s physical memory layout. These variables are shown in Table 2-10.

内核可能不会看到BIOS报告的所有物理内存:例如，如果内核没有使用PAE支持进行编译，那么它只能处理4gb RAM，即使实际上有更多的物理内存可用。setup_memory()函数在machine_specific_memory_setup()之后立即调用:它分析物理内存区域表，并初始化几个描述内核物理内存布局的变量。这些变量如表2-10所示。

表2-10. 描述内核物理内存布局的变量

| 变量名称      | 描述        |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| num_physpages     | 最高可用页帧编号 |
| totalram_pages    | 可用页帧总数 |
| min_low_pfn       | 内存中内核镜像之后第一个可用的页帧编号 |
| max_pfn           | 最后一个可用页帧编号 |
| max_low_pfn       | 内核直接映射的最后一页帧的页帧编号(low memory) |
| totalhigh_pages   | 内核没有映射的页帧总数 (high memory) |
| highstart_pfn     | 内核没有映射的第一个页帧编号 |
| highend_pfn       | 内核没有映射的最后一个页帧编号 |

To avoid loading the kernel into groups of noncontiguous page frames, Linux prefers to skip the first megabyte of RAM. Clearly, page frames not reserved by the PC architecture will be used by Linux to store dynamically assigned pages.

因为RAM的前1M空间使用不连续，所以，Linux跳过这一段内存空间。Linux使用PC架构没有保留的内存空间存储动态分配的页。

Figure 2-13 shows how the first 3 MB of RAM are filled by Linux. We have assumed that the kernel requires less than 3 MB of RAM.

图2-13展示了Linux如何填充前3M的RAM空间。假设内核小于3M。


The symbol _text, which corresponds to physical address 0x00100000, denotes the address of the first byte of kernel code. The end of the kernel code is similarly identified by the symbol _etext. Kernel data is divided into two groups: initialized and uninitialized. The initialized data starts right after _etext and ends at _edata. The uninitialized data follows and ends up at _end.

内核代码从符号`_text`-对应物理地址0x00100000-开始，到符号`_etext`处结束。内核数据分成2部分：初始化数据段和未初始化数据段。初始化数据段从`_etext`之后开始，在`_edata`处结束。未初始化数据段紧随其后，在`_end`处结束。

The symbols appearing in the figure are not defined in Linux source code; they are produced while compiling the kernel.*

上面提到的这些符号在Linux源代码中没有定义，是在编译时产生的。

<h3 id="2.5.4">2.5.4 进程页表</h3>

The linear address space of a process is divided into two parts:

进程的线性地址空间可以分为2部分：

* Linear addresses from 0x00000000 to 0xbfffffff can be addressed when the process runs in either User or Kernel Mode.

    线性地址空间0x00000000到0xbfffffff可以被用户空间或内核空间寻址。

* Linear addresses from 0xc0000000 to 0xffffffff can be addressed only when the process runs in Kernel Mode.

    线性地址空间0xc0000000到0xffffffff只被内核空间寻址。

When a process runs in User Mode, it issues linear addresses smaller than 0xc0000000; when it runs in Kernel Mode, it is executing kernel code and the linear addresses issued are greater than or equal to 0xc0000000. In some cases, however, the kernel must access the User Mode linear address space to retrieve or store data.

运行在用户态的进程发出的线性地址小于0xc0000000，运行在内核模式的进程，执行内核代码，发出的线性地址大于0xc0000000。但是，有些情况下，内核可以访问用户态的线性地址空间，以检索或者存储数据。

The `PAGE_OFFSET` macro yields the value 0xc0000000; this is the offset in the linear address space of a process where the kernel lives. In this book, we often refer directly to the number 0xc0000000 instead.

Linux源代码中使用宏PAGE_OFFSET=0xc0000000，这是内核所在进程的线性地址空间的偏移量。在本书中，往往直接使用这个值0xc0000000。

The content of the first entries of the Page Global Directory that map linear addresses lower than 0xc0000000 (the first 768 entries with PAE disabled, or the first 3 entries with PAE enabled) depends on the specific process. Conversely, the remaining entries should be the same for all processes and equal to the corresponding entries of the master kernel Page Global Directory (see the following section).

页全局目录中开头的项中映射的线性地址小于0xc0000000（PAE禁止时，是前768项；PAE使能时，是前3项），当然了，这跟具体的进程有关。也就是，运行在用户态的进程，其全局页表的内容映射小于0xc0000000的地址空间。与此相反，全局页表中剩余的项，对于所有的进程都是一样的，等于相应的主内核页全局目录中的项（参考下一节）。

<h3 id="2.5.5">2.5.5 内核页表</h3>

The kernel maintains a set of page tables for its own use, rooted at a so-called master kernel Page Global Directory. After system initialization, this set of page tables is never directly used by any process or kernel thread; rather, the highest entries of the master kernel Page Global Directory are the reference model for the corresponding entries of the Page Global Directories of every regular process in the system.

内核维护着一组页表供自己使用，这些表位于所谓的主内核页全局目录中。系统完成初始化后，这组页表永远不会被任何进程或内核线程直接访问。主内核页全局目录中的较高的项是系统中常规进程的页全局目录中对应项的引用模型。<font color="blue"> 也就是主内核页全局目录中较高的项就是指向内核自己使用的页表，这部分内容对于所有进程都是一样的，所以直接拷贝到常规进程的页全局目录中即可。</font>

We explain how the kernel ensures that changes to the master kernel Page Global Directory are propagated to the Page Global Directories that are actually used by processes in the section “Linear Addresses of Noncontiguous Memory Areas” in Chapter 8.

我们将在第8章的[非连续内存区域的线性地址](#8.3)一节中解释内核如何确保将对主内核页全局目录的更改传播到页全局目录，这些页全局目录实际上由进程使用。

We now describe how the kernel initializes its own page tables. This is a two-phase activity. In fact, right after the kernel image is loaded into memory, the CPU is still running in real mode; thus, paging is not enabled.

我们现在描述内核如何初始化它自己的页表，这分为2步。事实上，内核镜像刚刚加载到内存后，CPU仍然运行在实模式下，此时，分页单元还没使能。

In the first phase, the kernel creates a limited address space including the kernel’s code and data segments, the initial Page Tables, and 128 KB for some dynamic data structures. This minimal address space is just large enough to install the kernel in RAM and to initialize its core data structures.

第一步，内核创建有限的地址空间，存储内核代码和数据段，初始页表和存储动态数据结构的128K空间。这个最小的空间正好在RAM中安装内核代码，并初始化它的核心数据结构。

In the second phase, the kernel takes advantage of all of the existing RAM and sets up the page tables properly. Let us examine how this plan is executed.

第二步，内核充分利用已有的RAM，正确地建立页表。下面让我们详细讨论这个建立的过程。

<h4 id="2.5.5.1">2.5.5.1 临时内核页表</h4>

A provisional Page Global Directory is initialized statically during kernel compilation, while the provisional Page Tables are initialized by the startup_32() assembly language function defined in `arch/i386/kernel/head.S`. We won’t bother mentioning the Page Upper Directories and Page Middle Directories anymore, because they are equated to Page Global Directory entries. PAE support is not enabled at this stage.

临时页全局目录在内核编译期间静态初始化，而临时页表在startup_32()汇编函数中初始化，该函数位于 *arch/i386/kernel/head.S*文件中。我们不再提及页上层目录和页中间目录，因为它们等同于页全局目录。在这一阶段，PAE支持还没有使能。

The provisional Page Global Directory is contained in the `swapper_pg_dir` variable. The provisional Page Tables are stored starting from pg0, right after the end of the kernel’s uninitialized data segments (symbol `_end` in Figure 2-13). For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that the kernel’s segments, the provisional Page Tables, and the 128 KB memory area fit in the first 8 MB of RAM. In order to map 8 MB of RAM, two Page Tables are required.

临时页全局目录存储在变量`swapper_pg_dir`中。而临时页表存储在pg0页帧开始的物理地址中，其位于内核未初始化数据段结束处之后（[图2-13](Figure_2-13)中的符号`_end`处）。为了简单，我们假设内核的各个段，临时页表和128KB内存区域，都在RAM的前8M空间之内。为了映射这8M的RAM，需要2个页表。

The objective of this first phase of paging is to allow these 8 MB of RAM to be easily addressed both in real mode and protected mode. Therefore, the kernel must create a mapping from both the linear addresses 0x00000000 through 0x007fffff and the linear addresses 0xc0000000 through 0xc07fffff into the physical addresses 0x00000000 through 0x007fffff. In other words, the kernel during its first phase of initialization can address the first 8 MB of RAM by either linear addresses identical to the physical ones or 8 MB worth of linear addresses, starting from 0xc0000000.

第一步的分页目的是允许在实时模式和保护模式下，能够简单地对这8M空间进行寻址。因此，内核必须创建一个映射，将线性地址0x00000000~0x007fffff和线性地址0xc0000000~0xc07fffff都映射到物理地址0x00000000~0x007fffff上。换句话说，内核在初始化的第一步，通过使用与物理地址相同的线性地址或者从0xc0000000开始的8M线性空间访问RAM的前8M空间。

The Kernel creates the desired mapping by filling all the swapper_pg_dir entries with zeroes, except for entries 0, 1, 0x300 (decimal 768), and 0x301 (decimal 769); the latter two entries span all linear addresses between 0xc0000000 and 0xc07fffff. The 0, 1, 0x300, and 0x301 entries are initialized as follows:

内核通过填充`swapper_pg_dir`中的0、1、0x300（768）和0x301（769）这几项，其余位置填充0，来创建想要的映射。后面2项的范围正好是0xc0000000~0xc07fffff。初始化如下：

* The address field of entries 0 and 0x300 is set to the physical address of pg0, while the address field of entries 1 and 0x301 is set to the physical address of the page frame following pg0.

    0和0x300设置为pg0的物理地址，1和0x301设置成pg1的地址

* The Present, Read/Write, and User/Supervisor flags are set in all four entries.

    4项的Present、Read/Write和User/Supervisor标志被置1


* The Accessed, Dirty, PCD, PWD, and Page Size flags are cleared in all four entries.

    4项的Accessed、Dirty、PCD、PWD和PS标志被清除

The `startup_32()` assembly language function also enables the paging unit. This is achieved by loading the physical address of `swapper_pg_dir` into the `cr3` control register and by setting the `PG` flag of the `cr0` control register, as shown in the following equivalent code fragment:

然后，startup_32()汇编函数使能分页单元。把swapper_pg_dir的物理地址写入cr3寄存器，并设置cr0寄存器的PG标志使能分页机制。代码片段如下：

    movl $swapper_pg_dir-0xc0000000, %eax
    movl %eax, %cr3                         /* 设置页表指针 */
    movl %cr0, %eax
    orl $0x80000000, %eax
    movl %eax, %cr0                         /* 设置PG标志位 */

> <font color="blue"> swapper_pg_dir的地址是在编译代码的时候静态指定的。</font>

<h4 id="2.5.5.2">2.5.5.2 内核页表（RAM < 896M）</h4>

The final mapping provided by the kernel page tables must transform linear addresses starting from 0xc0000000 into physical addresses starting from 0.

由内核页表提供的映射必须能够把从`0xc0000000`开始的线性地址转换成从0开始的物理地址。

The `__pa` macro is used to convert a linear address starting from PAGE_OFFSET to the corresponding physical address, while the __va macro does the reverse.

宏__pa能够把一个从PAGE_OFFSET(0xC0000000)开始的线性地址转换成物理地址，而宏__va实现逆操作。

The master kernel Page Global Directory is still stored in `swapper_pg_dir`. It is initialized by the `paging_init()` function, which does the following:

主内核页全局目录仍然在swapper_pg_dir变量中，它由paging_init()函数进行初始化：

1. 调用pagetable_init()建立页表项；
2. 写swapper_pg_dir的物理地址到cr3寄存器中；
3. 如果内核编译选择支持PAE，设置cr4寄存器中的PAE标志；
4. 调用`__flush_tlb_all()`函数使所有TLB无效。

The actions performed by `pagetable_init()` depend on both the amount of RAM present and on the CPU model. Let’s start with the simplest case. Our computer has less than 896 MB of RAM, 32-bit physical addresses are sufficient to address all the available RAM, and there is no need to activate the PAE mechanism. (See the earlier section “The Physical Address Extension (PAE) Paging Mechanism.”)

pagetable_init()函数所做的操作依赖于RAM的实际数量和CPU模型。让我们从最简单的一种情况说起，假设我们的计算机内存小于896MB，32位的物理地址寻址足够了，没有必要激活PAE功能。

The `swapper_pg_dir` Page Global Directory is reinitialized by a cycle equivalent to the following:

swapper_pg_dir页全局目录重新初始化，代码片段如下：

    pgd = swapper_pg_dir + pgd_index(PAGE_OFFSET); /* 768 */
    phys_addr = 0x00000000;
    while (phys_addr < (max_low_pfn * PAGE_SIZE)) {
        pmd = one_md_table_init(pgd); /* returns pgd itself */
        set_pmd(pmd, __pmd(phys_addr | pgprot_val(__pgprot(0x1e3))));
        /* 0x1e3 == Present, Accessed, Dirty, Read/Write, Page Size, Global */
        phys_addr += PTRS_PER_PTE * PAGE_SIZE; /* 0x400000 */
        ++pgd;
    }

> The highest 128 MB of linear addresses are left available for several kinds of mappings (see sections “Fix-Mapped Linear Addresses” later in this chapter and “Linear Addresses of Noncontiguous Memory Areas” in Chapter 8). The kernel address space left for mapping the RAM is thus 1 GB – 128 MB = 896 MB.

We assume that the CPU is a recent 80×86 microprocessor supporting 4 MB pages and “global” TLB entries. Notice that the User/Supervisor flags in all Page Global Directory entries referencing linear addresses above 0xc0000000 are cleared, thus denying processes in User Mode access to the kernel address space. Notice also that the Page Size flag is set so that the kernel can address the RAM by making use of large pages (see the section “Extended Paging” earlier in this chapter).

我们假设CPU是最新的x86处理器，支持4M大小的页和全局的TLB项。引用大于0xc0000000的线性地址的所有页全局目录项中的User/Supervisor标志被清除，阻止用户态的进程访问内核空间。还要注意，Page Size标志被设置，所以内核可以使用大页访问RAM（查看前面的扩展分页一节）。

The identity mapping of the first megabytes of physical memory (8 MB in our example) built by the startup_32() function is required to complete the initialization phase of the kernel. When this mapping is no longer necessary, the kernel clears the corresponding page table entries by invoking the zap_low_mappings() function.

在startup_32()函数构建的8M物理内存的线性地址映射，是要完成内核初始化所需要的。当这个映射不再需要的时候，内核通过调用zap_low_mappings()函数清除相应的页表项。

Actually, this description does not state the whole truth. As we’ll see in the later section “Fix-Mapped Linear Addresses,” the kernel also adjusts the entries of Page Tables corresponding to the “fix-mapped linear addresses.”

事实上，这里的描述没有说明全部情况，后面我们还会看到[固定映射的线性地址](#2.5.6)一节，内核还会调整对应的页表项，指向固定映射的线性地址。

<h4 id="2.5.5.3">2.5.5.3 内核页表（896M < RAM < 4096M）</h4>

In this case, the RAM cannot be mapped entirely into the kernel linear address space. The best Linux can do during the initialization phase is to map a RAM window of size 896 MB into the kernel linear address space. If a program needs to address other parts of the existing RAM, some other linear address interval must be mapped to the required RAM. This implies changing the value of some page table entries. We’ll discuss how this kind of dynamic remapping is done in Chapter 8.

在这种情况下，RAM不能被整个映射到内核的线性地址空间。Linux在初始化阶段，将大小为896M的RAM空间映射到内核线性地址空间。如果程序需要访问已有RAM的其它部分，就需要把其它的线性地址映射到想要的RAM上。这意味着改变某些页表项的值。我们将在第8章讨论这种动态映射。

To initialize the Page Global Directory, the kernel uses the same code as in the previous case.

为了初始化页全局目录，内核使用相同的代码。

<h4 id="2.5.5.4">2.5.5.4 内核页表（RAM > 4096M）</h4>

Let’s now consider kernel Page Table initialization for computers with more than 4 GB; more precisely, we deal with cases in which the following happens:

让我们考虑一下当内存大于4G时，内核页表的初始化。更精确地说，我们将处理一下几种情况：

* The CPU model supports Physical Address Extension (PAE).

    CPU支持物理地址扩展（PAE）。

* The amount of RAM is larger than 4 GB.

    RAM大于4G。

* The kernel is compiled with PAE support.

    内核编译支持PAE。

Although PAE handles 36-bit physical addresses, linear addresses are still 32-bit addresses. As in the previous case, Linux maps a 896-MB RAM window into the kernel linear address space; the remaining RAM is left unmapped and handled by dynamic remapping, as described in Chapter 8. The main difference with the previous case is that a three-level paging model is used, so the Page Global Directory is initialized by a cycle equivalent to the following:

尽管PAE支持36位物理地址，但线性地址仍然是32位的。如前面的情况一样，Linux也是映射896M大小的RAM到内核线性地址空间上；余下的RAM保持未映射，由动态重映射分配，如第8章描述所示。与前面情况不同的是，使用的是3级分页机制，所以页全局目录的初始化如下所示：

    pgd_idx = pgd_index(PAGE_OFFSET); /* 3 */
    for (i=0; i<pgd_idx; i++)
        set_pgd(swapper_pg_dir + i, __pgd(__pa(empty_zero_page) + 0x001));
        /* 0x001 == Present */
    pgd = swapper_pg_dir + pgd_idx;
    phys_addr = 0x00000000;
    for (; i<PTRS_PER_PGD; ++i, ++pgd) {
        pmd = (pmd_t *) alloc_bootmem_low_pages(PAGE_SIZE);
        set_pgd(pgd, __pgd(__pa(pmd) | 0x001)); /* 0x001 == Present */
        if (phys_addr < max_low_pfn * PAGE_SIZE)
            for (j=0; j < PTRS_PER_PMD /* 512 */
                    && phys_addr < max_low_pfn*PAGE_SIZE; ++j) {
                set_pmd(pmd, __pmd(phys_addr | pgprot_val(__pgprot(0x1e3))));
                /* 0x1e3 == Present, Accessed, Dirty, Read/Write,  Page Size, Global */
                phys_addr += PTRS_PER_PTE * PAGE_SIZE; /* 0x200000 */
            }
    }
    swapper_pg_dir[0] = swapper_pg_dir[pgd_idx];

The kernel initializes the first three entries in the Page Global Directory corresponding to the user linear address space with the address of an empty page (empty_zero_page). The fourth entry is initialized with the address of a Page Middle Directory (pmd) allocated by invoking alloc_bootmem_low_pages(). The first 448 entries in the Page Middle Directory (there are 512 entries, but the last 64 are reserved for noncontiguous memory allocation; see the section “Noncontiguous Memory Area Management” in Chapter 8) are filled with the physical address of the first 896 MB of RAM.

内核使用空页地址（empty_zero_page）初始化前3个页全局目录项的线性地址。第4项使用alloc_bootmem_low_pages()函数获取的页中间目录（pmd）初始化。页中间目录的前448项使用896M大小的RAM的物理地址填充（总共512项，但是最后的64项为非连续内存分配空间保留，请看第8章的[非连续内存区管理](#8.3)一节）。

Notice that all CPU models that support PAE also support large 2-MB pages and global pages. As in the previous cases, whenever possible, Linux uses large pages to reduce the number of Page Tables.

注意，所有支持PAE的CPU也都支持2M的大页和全局页。如前所述，只要有可能，Linux就应该使用大页减少页表的数量。

The fourth Page Global Directory entry is then copied into the first entry, so as to mirror the mapping of the low physical memory in the first 896 MB of the linear address space. This mapping is required in order to complete the initialization of SMPsystems: when it is no longer necessary, the kernel clears the corresponding page table entries by invoking the zap_low_mappings() function, as in the previous cases.

为了镜像线性地址空间的前896M中的低物理内存的映射，可以把页全局目录的第四项拷贝到第一项中。为了完成SMP系统的初始化，这种映射是需要的：不再需要的时候，可以调用zap_low_mappings()函数清除相应的页表项。

<h3 id="2.5.6">2.5.6 固定映射的线性地址</h3>

We saw that the initial part of the fourth gigabyte of kernel linear addresses maps the physical memory of the system. However, at least 128 MB of linear addresses are always left available because the kernel uses them to implement noncontiguous memory allocation and fix-mapped linear addresses.

我们已经看过了4G内核线性地址的开始部分是如何映射到物理地址的。但是，至少128M的线性地址总是保留的，因为内核使用它们实现非连续内存分配和固定映射线性地址。

Noncontiguous memory allocation is just a special way to dynamically allocate and release pages of memory, and is described in the section “Linear Addresses of Noncontiguous Memory Areas” in Chapter 8. In this section, we focus on fix-mapped linear addresses.

非连续内存分配是动态分配和释放内存页一种方法，第8章的[非连续内存的线性地址](#8.3.1)一节讲解。在这儿，我们只专注于固定映射的线性地址。

Basically, a fix-mapped linear address is a constant linear address like 0xffffc000 whose corresponding physical address does not have to be the linear address minus 0xc000000, but rather a physical address set in an arbitrary way. Thus, each fixmapped linear address maps one page frame of the physical memory. As we’ll see in later chapters, the kernel uses fix-mapped linear addresses instead of pointer variables that never change their value.

基本上，固定映射的线性地址是类似于0xffffc000一样的常量线性地址，它映射的物理地址不必是线性地址减去0xc000000，而是一个以任意方式分配的物理地址。每个固定映射的线性地址映射一个物理内存的页帧。正如我们在后面的章节中看到的那样，内核使用固定映射的线性地址，而不是永远不会改变它们的值的指针变量。

Fix-mapped linear addresses are conceptually similar to the linear addresses that map the first 896 MB of RAM. However, a fix-mapped linear address can map any physical address, while the mapping established by the linear addresses in the initial portion of the fourth gigabyte is linear (linear address X maps physical address X–PAGE_OFFSET).

固定映射的线性地址概念上和映射896M内存的线性地址相似。但是，固定映射的线性地址能映射任意物理地址，而4G线性地址空间的开头部分建立的映射是线性的（线性地址X映射的物理地址空间是X–PAGE_OFFSET）。

With respect to variable pointers, fix-mapped linear addresses are more efficient. In fact, dereferencing a variable pointer requires one memory access more than dereferencing an immediate constant address. Moreover, checking the value of a variable pointer before dereferencing it is a good programming practice; conversely, the check is never required for a constant linear address.

相比指针变量，固定映射的线性地址更有效。解引用一个指针变量比解引用一个立即数常量地址需要更多的内存访问。此外，在解引用一个指针变量之前，检查它的值是一个好的编程习惯；相反，对于常量线性地址是不会进行检查的。

Each fix-mapped linear address is represented by a small integer index defined in the `enum fixed_addresses` data structure:

固定映射的线性地址使用`enum fixed_addresses`数据结构表示，每一项都是一个整数索引定义的。

    enum fixed_addresses {
        FIX_HOLE,
        FIX_VSYSCALL,
        FIX_APIC_BASE,
        FIX_IO_APIC_BASE_0,
        [...]
        __end_of_fixed_addresses
    };

Fix-mapped linear addresses are placed at the end of the fourth gigabyte of linear addresses. The `fix_to_virt()` function computes the constant linear address starting from the index:

固定映射的线性地址放在4G空间的最后。fix_to_virt()函数根据索引计算常量线性地址：

    inline unsigned long fix_to_virt(const unsigned int idx)
    {
        if (idx >= __end_of_fixed_addresses)
            __this_fixmap_does_not_exist();
        return (0xfffff000UL - (idx << PAGE_SHIFT));
    }


Let’s assume that some kernel function invokes fix_to_virt(FIX_IO_APIC_BASE_0). Because the function is declared as “inline,” the C compiler does not generate a call to `fix_to_virt()`, but inserts its code in the calling function. Moreover, the check on the index value is never performed at runtime. In fact, FIX_IO_APIC_BASE_0 is a constant equal to 3, so the compiler can cut away the `if` statement because its condition is false at compile time. Conversely, if the condition is true or the argument of `fix_to_virt()` is not a constant, the compiler issues an error during the linking phase because the symbol `__this_fixmap_does_not_exist` is not defined anywhere. Eventually, the compiler computes `0xfffff000-(3<<PAGE_SHIFT)` and replaces the `fix_to_virt()` function call with the constant linear address 0xffffc000.

假设某些内核函数调用fix_to_virt(FIX_IO_APIC_BASE_0)。因为这个函数被声明为inline函数，C编译器不会产生fix_to_virt()的调用，而是直接把它的代码插入到调用函数的相应位置。更重要的是，运行时不会检查idex的值。事实上，FIX_IO_APIC_BASE_0是一个常量，等于3，if语句的条件为false，直接返回线性地址。相反，如果条件为真或者参数idx不是常量，编译器会在链接阶段发出错误，因为符号__this_fixmap_does_not_exist没有定义。最后编译器计算0xfffff000-(3<<PAGE_SHIFT)，用其结果0xffffc000代替fix_to_virt()函数调用。

To associate a physical address with a fix-mapped linear address, the kernel uses the `set_fixmap(idx,phys)` and `set_fixmap_nocache(idx,phys)` macros. Both of them initialize the Page Table entry corresponding to the `fix_to_virt(idx)` linear address with the physical address `phys`; however, the second function also sets the `PCD` flag of the Page Table entry, thus disabling the hardware cache when accessing the data in the page frame (see the section “Hardware Cache” earlier in this chapter). Conversely, `clear_fixmap(idx)` removes the linking between a fix-mapped linear address idx and the physical address.

为了关联固定映射的线性地址与物理地址，内核使用set_fixmap(idx,phys)和set_fixmap_nocache(idx,phys)两个宏建立映射。它们都会使用物理地址phys初始化fix_to_virt(idx)对应的页表项；但是，第二个函数还会设置页表项的PCD标志，从而在访问页帧中的数据时禁止硬件Cache。反过来，clear_fixmap(idx)函数解除固定映射的线性地址与物理地址的映射。

<h3 id="2.5.7">2.5.7 处理Cache和TLB</h3>

The last topic of memory addressing deals with how the kernel makes an optimal use of the hardware caches. Hardware caches and Translation Lookaside Buffers play a crucial role in boosting the performance of modern computer architectures. Several techniques are used by kernel developers to reduce the number of cache and TLB misses.

<h4 id="2.5.7.1">2.5.7.1 处理Cache</h4>

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, hardware caches are addressed by cache lines. The `L1_CACHE_BYTES` macro yields the size of a cache line in bytes. On Intel models earlier than the Pentium 4, the macro yields the value 32; on a Pentium 4, it yields the value 128.

To optimize the cache hit rate, the kernel considers the architecture in making the following decisions.

为了优化Cache的命中率，内核采用下面的思想：

* The most frequently used fields of a data structure are placed at the low offset within the data structure, so they can be cached in the same line.

    考虑把使用频率最高的数据结构的成员放到结构开始的地方，尽可能的在同一个line中缓存。

* When allocating a large set of data structures, the kernel tries to store each of them in memory in such a way that all cache lines are used uniformly.

    当分配一组大型数据结构时，内核尝试所有统一均匀的使用所有Cache行的方式存储这些结构中的每一个。

Cache synchronization is performed automatically by the 80×86 microprocessors, thus the Linux kernel for this kind of processor does not perform any hardware cache flushing. The kernel does provide, however, cache flushing interfaces for processors that do not synchronize caches.

<h4 id="2.5.7.2">2.5.7.2 处理TLB</h4>

Processors cannot synchronize their own TLB cache automatically because it is the kernel, and not the hardware, that decides when a mapping between a linear and a physical address is no longer valid.

Linux 2.6 offers several TLB flush methods that should be applied appropriately, depending on the type of page table change (see Table 2-11).

Table 2-11. Architecture-independent TLB-invalidating methods

| Method name | Description | Typically used when |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| flush_tlb_all | Flushes all TLB entries (including those that refer to global pages, that is, pages whose Global flag is set) | Changing the kernel page table entries |
| flush_tlb_kernel_range | Flushes all TLB entries in a given range of linear addresses (including those that refer to global pages) | Changing a range of kernel page table entries |
| flush_tlb | Flushes all TLB entries of the non-global pages owned by the current process | Performing a process switch |
| flush_tlb_mm | Flushes all TLB entries of the non-global pages owned by a given process | Forking a new process |
| flush_tlb_range | Flushes the TLB entries corresponding to a linear address interval of a given process | Releasing a linear address interval of a process |
| flush_tlb_pgtables | Flushes the TLB entries of a given contiguous subset of page tables of a given process | Releasing some page tables of a process |
| flush_tlb_page | Flushes the TLB of a single Page Table entry of a given process | Processing a Page Fault |

Despite the rich set of TLB methods offered by the generic Linux kernel, every microprocessor usually offers a far more restricted set of TLB-invalidating assembly language instructions. In this respect, one of the more flexible hardware platforms is Sun’s UltraSPARC. In contrast, Intel microprocessors offers only two TLB-invalidating techniques:

* All Pentium models automatically flush the TLB entries relative to non-global pages when a value is loaded into the cr3 register.

* In Pentium Pro and later models, the invlpg assembly language instruction invalidates a single TLB entry mapping a given linear address.

Table 2-12 lists the Linux macros that exploit such hardware techniques; these macros are the basic ingredients to implement the architecture-independent methods listed in Table 2-11.

Table 2-12. TLB-invalidating macros for the Intel Pentium Pro and later processors

| Method name | Description | Typically used when |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| __flush_tlb() | Rewrites cr3 register back into itself | flush_tlb, flush_tlb_mm, flush_tlb_range |
| __flush_tlb_global() | Disables global pages by clearing the PGE flag of cr4, rewrites cr3 register back into itself, and sets again the PGE flag | flush_tlb_all, flush_tlb_kernel_range |
| __flush_tlb_single(addr) | Executes invlpg assembly language instruction with parameter addr | flush_tlb_page |

Notice that the flush_tlb_pgtables method is missing from Table 2-12: in the 80×86 architecture nothing has to be done when a page table is unlinked from its parent table, thus the function implementing this method is empty.

The architecture-independent TLB-invalidating methods are extended quite simply to multiprocessor systems. The function running on a CPU sends an Interprocessor Interrupt (see “Interprocessor Interrupt Handling” in Chapter 4) to the other CPUs that forces them to execute the proper TLB-invalidating function.

As a general rule, any process switch implies changing the set of active page tables. Local TLB entries relative to the old page tables must be flushed; this is done automatically when the kernel writes the address of the new Page Global Directory into the cr3 control register. The kernel succeeds, however, in avoiding TLB flushes in the following cases:


* When performing a process switch between two regular processes that use the same set of page tables (see the section “The schedule() Function” in Chapter 7).

* When performing a process switch between a regular process and a kernel thread. In fact, we’ll see in the section “Memory Descriptor of Kernel Threads” in Chapter 9, that kernel threads do not have their own set of page tables; rather, they use the set of page tables owned by the regular process that was scheduled last for execution on the CPU.

Besides process switches, there are other cases in which the kernel needs to flush some entries in a TLB. For instance, when the kernel assigns a page frame to a User Mode process and stores its physical address into a Page Table entry, it must flush any local TLB entry that refers to the corresponding linear address. On multiprocessor systems, the kernel also must flush the same TLB entry on the CPUs that are using the same set of page tables, if any.

To avoid useless TLB flushing in multiprocessor systems, the kernel uses a technique called lazy TLBmode . The basic idea is the following: if several CPUs are using the same page tables and a TLB entry must be flushed on all of them, then TLB flushing may, in some cases, be delayed on CPUs running kernel threads. In fact, each kernel thread does not have its own set of page tables; rather, it makes use of the set of page tables belonging to a regular process. However, there is no need to invalidate a TLB entry that refers to a User Mode linear address, because no kernel thread accesses the User Mode address space.*

When some CPUs start running a kernel thread, the kernel sets it into lazy TLB mode. When requests are issued to clear some TLB entries, each CPU in lazy TLB mode does not flush the corresponding entries; however, the CPU remembers that its current process is running on a set of page tables whose TLB entries for the User Mode addresses are invalid. As soon as the CPU in lazy TLB mode switches to a regular process with a different set of page tables, the hardware automatically flushes the TLB entries, and the kernel sets the CPU back in non-lazy TLB mode. However, if a CPU in lazy TLB mode switches to a regular process that owns the same set of page tables used by the previously running kernel thread, then any deferred TLB invalidation must be effectively applied by the kernel. This “lazy” invalidation is effectively achieved by flushing all non-global TLB entries of the CPU.

Some extra data structures are needed to implement the lazy TLB mode. The cpu_tlbstate variable is a static array of NR_CPUS structures (the default value for this macro is 32; it denotes the maximum number of CPUs in the system) consisting of an active_mm field pointing to the memory descriptor of the current process (see Chapter 9) and a state flag that can assume only two values: TLBSTATE_OK (non-lazy TLB mode) or TLBSTATE_LAZY (lazy TLB mode). Furthermore, each memory descriptor includes a cpu_vm_mask field that stores the indices of the CPUs that should receive Interprocessor Interrupts related to TLB flushing. This field is meaningful only when the memory descriptor belongs to a process currently in execution.

When a CPU starts executing a kernel thread, the kernel sets the state field of its cpu_tlbstate element to TLBSTATE_LAZY; moreover, the cpu_vm_mask field of the active memory descriptor stores the indices of all CPUs in the system, including the one that is entering in lazy TLB mode. When another CPU wants to invalidate the TLB entries of all CPUs relative to a given set of page tables, it delivers an Interprocessor Interrupt to all CPUs whose indices are included in the cpu_vm_mask field of the corresponding memory descriptor.

When a CPU receives an Interprocessor Interrupt related to TLB flushing and verifies that it affects the set of page tables of its current process, it checks whether the state field of its cpu_tlbstate element is equal to TLBSTATE_LAZY. In this case, the kernel refuses to invalidate the TLB entries and removes the CPU index from the cpu_vm_mask field of the memory descriptor. This has two consequences:

* As long as the CPU remains in lazy TLB mode, it will not receive other Interprocessor Interrupts related to TLB flushing.

* If the CPU switches to another process that is using the same set of page tables as the kernel thread that is being replaced, the kernel invokes __flush_tlb() to invalidate all non-global TLB entries of the CPU.

<h1 id="3">3 进程</h1>

The concept of a process is fundamental to any multiprogramming operating system. A process is usually defined as an instance of a program in execution; thus, if 16 users are running vi at once, there are 16 separate processes (although they can share the same executable code). Processes are often called tasks or threads in the Linux source code.

进程的概念是多任务操作系统的基础。一个进程通常是正在执行的程序的一个实例，比如说，如果16个用户同时运行vi编辑器，就会有16个独立的进程（尽管它们共享相同的可执行代码）。在Linux源代码中，进程经常被称为任务或线程。

In this chapter, we discuss static properties of processes and then describe how process switching is performed by the kernel. The last two sections describe how processes can be created and destroyed. We also describe how Linux supports multithreaded applications—as mentioned in Chapter 1, it relies on so-called lightweight processes (LWP).

在本章中，我们将讨论进程的静态属性，然后描述内核如何实施进程切换。最后两节描述进程的创建和销毁。我们还会描述Linux如何支持多线程程序，正如我们在第1章提到的，它依赖与所谓的轻进程（LWP）。

<h2 id="3.1">3.1 进程、轻量级进程和线程</h2>

The term “process” is often used with several different meanings. In this book, we stick to the usual OS textbook definition: a process is an instance of a program in execution. You might think of it as the collection of data structures that fully describes how far the execution of the program has progressed.

术语"进程"经常被赋予不同的意义。在本书中，我们坚持操作系统教科书中的定义：进程时正在执行程序的实例。你可以认为进程就是一个数据结构的集合，完整地描述了程序执行的进度。

> <font color="blue">补充：

> 现代操作系统的概念中，进程就是线程的容器，线程是内核调度的最小执行单元。一个正在执行的程序可以有多个进程，而进程又可以有多个线程。线程的划分粒度更小，导致并发性更高。另外，进程可以拥有独立的内存单元，而线程共享内存，从而极大提高了程序的运行效率。

Processes are like human beings: they are generated, they have a more or less significant life, they optionally generate one or more child processes, and eventually they die. A small difference is that sex is not really common among processes—each process has just one parent.

进程像极了人类：它们被创造，拥有一个或轻或重的人生，它们可以任意创建一个或多个子进程，最后死亡。一个细微的不同就是，进程没有性别之分，每个进程只有一个父进程。

From the kernel’s point of view, the purpose of a process is to act as an entity to which system resources (CPU time, memory, etc.) are allocated.

从内核的角度看，进程就是分配系统资源（CPU时间、内存等）的实体单元。

When a process is created, it is almost identical to its parent. It receives a (logical) copy of the parent’s address space and executes the same code as the parent, beginning at the next instruction following the process creation system call. Although the parent and child may share the pages containing the program code (text), they have separate copies of the data (stack and heap), so that changes by the child to a memory location are invisible to the parent (and vice versa).

当进程被创建时，几乎与父进程相同。它拷贝父进程的地址空间，执行与父进程一样的代码，从创建进程的系统调用的下一条指令开始执行。尽管父进程和子进程共享代码段，但是它们具有独立的数据拷贝（堆栈），以至于子进程修改内存的某个位置，对父进程是不可见的，等等。

While earlier Unix kernels employed this simple model, modern Unix systems do not. They support  multithreaded applications—user programs having many relatively independent execution flows sharing a large portion of the application data structures. In such systems, a process is composed of several user threads (or simply threads), each of which represents an execution flow of the process. Nowadays, most multithreaded applications are written using standard sets of library functions called pthread (POSIX thread) libraries.

早期的Unix内核采用这种简单的模型，但是现代Unix系统已经不是了。它们支持多线程程序：用户程序具有许多相对独立的执行流，它们共享大部分的数据结构。在这样的系统中，进程由多个用户线程组成（或单线程），每个线程代表进程的一个执行流。现在，大多数多线程程序都是使用标准线程库（POSIX-thread）的库函数编写的。

Older versions of the Linux kernel offered no support for multithreaded applications. From the kernel point of view, a multithreaded application was just a normal process. The multiple execution flows of a multithreaded application were created, handled, and scheduled entirely in User Mode, usually by means of a POSIX-compliant pthread library.

旧版本的Linux内核不支持多线程程序。它们认为，从内核的角度看，一个多线程程序就是一个普通的进程。完全可以通过使用与POSIX兼容的pthread库，实现在用户态下创建，处理和调度多线程程序的多个执行流。

However, such an implementation of multithreaded applications is not very satisfactory. For instance, suppose a chess program uses two threads: one of them controls the graphical chessboard, waiting for the moves of the human player and showing the moves of the computer, while the other thread ponders the next move of the game. While the first thread waits for the human move, the second thread should run continuously, thus exploiting the thinking time of the human player. However, if the chess program is just a single process, the first thread cannot simply issue a blocking system call waiting for a user action; otherwise, the second thread is blocked as well. Instead, the first thread must employ sophisticated nonblocking techniques to ensure that the process remains runnable.

但是，这样的多线程程序实现不是很令人满意。比如，假设一个国际象棋游戏程序，使用2个线程：其中的一个线程控制棋盘，等待用户的动作并显示计算机的动作，而另一个线程思考游戏的下一步动作。当第一个线程等待人类用户的动作时，第二个线程还应该继续运行，从而充分利用人类选手的思考时间。但是，如果象棋游戏程序就是一个单进程程序的话，第一个线程不能简单地发出一个阻塞系统调用等待用户动作；否则，第二个线程也被阻塞。除非第一个线程必须采用复杂的非阻塞技术才能保证进程继续运行。

Linux uses lightweight processes to offer better support for multithreaded applications. Basically, two lightweight processes may share some resources, like the address space, the open files, and so on. Whenever one of them modifies a shared resource, the other immediately sees the change. Of course, the two processes must synchronize themselves when accessing the shared resource.

Linux采用轻进程（LWP）的方法提供更好的多线程程序支持。大体上，两个轻进程共享某些资源，像地址空间，打开的文件等等。当一个轻进程修改了某个共享资源，另一个立即能看到变化。当然了，两个轻进程必须在访问共享资源的时候实现同步。

A straightforward way to implement multithreaded applications is to associate a lightweight process with each thread. In this way, the threads can access the same set of application data structures by simply sharing the same memory address space, the same set of open files, and so on; at the same time, each thread can be scheduled independently by the kernel so that one may sleep while another remains runnable. Examples of POSIX-compliant pthread libraries that use Linux’s lightweight processes are LinuxThreads, Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL), and IBM’s Next Generation Posix Threading Package (NGPT).

实现多线程程序的最直接方式就是将一个轻进程和一个线程关联起来。这种方法，线程们通过共享相同的资源，比如，内存地址空间，打开的文件等，能够访问相同的应用程序的数据结构。同时，每一个线程可以被内核独立调度，这样，当一个线程休眠的时候，另一个仍然可以运行。使用了Linux轻进程技术并与POSIX兼容的pthread库的例子有LinuxThreads、Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL)和IBM的下一代Posix线程包（NGPT）。

POSIX-compliant multithreaded applications are best handled by kernels that support “thread groups.” In Linux a thread group is basically a set of lightweight processes that implement a multithreaded application and act as a whole with regards to some system calls such as getpid(), kill(), and _exit(). We are going to describe them at length later in this chapter.

与POSIX兼容的多线程程序最好是由支持`线程组`的内核处理。Linux中，线程组基本上是由一组轻进程（LWP）组成的，他们实现一个多线程程序，并作为一个整体，处理一些系统调用诸如getpid()、kill()和_exit()。在本章的后面我们将描述它们。

<h2 id="3.2">3.2 进程描述符</h2>

To manage processes, the kernel must have a clear picture of what each process is doing. It must know, for instance, the process’s priority, whether it is running on a CPU or blocked on an event, what address space has been assigned to it, which files it is allowed to address, and so on. This is the role of the process descriptor—a task_struct type structure whose fields contain all the information related to a single process.* As the repository of so much information, the process descriptor is rather complex. In addition to a large number of fields containing process attributes, the process descriptor contains several pointers to other data structures that, in turn, contain pointers to other structures. Figure 3-1 describes the Linux process descriptor schematically.

为了管理进程，内核必须清楚的知道每个进程在做什么。比如，进程优先级，正在CPU上运行还是阻塞在某个事件上，分配给它的进程地址空间，允许访问的文件等等。对于这些，内核使用进程描述符记录这一切，数据结构是task_struct，在这个结构中，包含单个进程的所有信息。包含了这么多信息，进程描述符相当复杂。除了大量包含进程属性的成员之外，还包含了几个指向其它数据结构的指针，进一步，这些其它数据结构又包含指向更多数据结构的指针。图3-1概要性地描述了Linux进程描述符。

The six data structures on the right side of the figure refer to specific resources owned by the process. Most of these resources will be covered in future chapters. This chapter focuses on two types of fields that refer to the process state and to process parent/child relationships.

图中右边的6个数据结构都是进程拥有的具体资源。这些资源的大部分会在后面的章节中覆盖到。本章主要关注两部分，分别是进程状态和父、子进程的关系。

<img id="Figure_3-1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_3_1.PNG">

图3-1 Linux进程描述符示意图

<h3 id="3.2.1">3.2.1 进程状态</h3>

As its name implies, the state field of the process descriptor describes what is currently happening to the process. It consists of an array of flags, each of which describes a possible process state. In the current Linux version, these states are mutually exclusive, and hence exactly one flag of state always is set; the remaining flags are cleared. The following are the possible process states:

1. TASK_RUNNING-运行态

    The process is either executing on a CPU or waiting to be executed.

2. TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE-阻塞态（可中断）

    The process is suspended (sleeping) until some condition becomes true. Raising a hardware interrupt, releasing a system resource the process is waiting for, or delivering a signal are examples of conditions that might wake up the process (put its state back to TASK_RUNNING).


3. TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE-阻塞态（不可中断）

    Like TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, except that delivering a signal to the sleeping process leaves its state unchanged. This process state is seldom used. It is valuable, however, under certain specific conditions in which a process must wait until a given event occurs without being interrupted. For instance, this state may be used when a process opens a device file and the corresponding device driver starts probing for a corresponding hardware device. The device driver must not be interrupted until the probing is complete, or the hardware device could be left in an unpredictable state.

4. TASK_STOPPED-终止态（不可中断）

    Process execution has been stopped; the process enters this state after receiving a SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU signal.

5. TASK_TRACED-跟踪态

    Process execution has been stopped by a debugger. When a process is being monitored by another (such as when a debugger executes a ptrace() system call to monitor a test program), each signal may put the process in the TASK_TRACED state.

Two additional states of the process can be stored both in the `state` field and in the `exit_state` field of the process descriptor; as the field name suggests, a process reaches one of these two states only when its execution is terminated:

其实，进程还有2个状态，分别存储在进程描述符的state和exit_state两个成员中；它们都是进程终止后的状态：

1. EXIT_ZOMBIE

    Process execution is terminated, but the parent process has not yet issued a `wait4()` or `waitpid()` system call to return information about the dead process.* Before the wait()-like call is issued, the kernel cannot discard the data contained in the dead process descriptor because the parent might need it. (See the section “Process Removal” near the end of this chapter.)

    僵尸进程标志。进程执行中止，但是父进程还没有发起wait4()或waitpid()系统调用返回关于这个死亡进程的信息。在收到信息之前，内核不能抛弃这个死亡进程描述符中的数据，因为父进程可能还需要。（参见本章最后的[移除进程](#3.5.2)一节）

2. EXIT_DEAD

    The final state: the process is being removed by the system because the parent process has just issued a `wait4()` or `waitpid()` system call for it. Changing its state from EXIT_ZOMBIE to EXIT_DEAD avoids race conditions due to other threads of execution that execute wait()-like calls on the same process (see Chapter 5).

    死亡进程标志。父进程已经发出wait4()或waitpid()系统调用，进程将要被移除。将进程的状态从EXIT_ZOMBIE更改为EXIT_DEAD可以避免竞态条件，因为其他执行的线程也可能给相同的线程发送wait()类似的调用。（见[第5章](#5)）

The value of the `state` field is usually set with a simple assignment. For instance:

改变state的值非常简单，如下所示：

    p->state = TASK_RUNNING;

The kernel also uses the `set_task_state` and `set_current_state` macros: they set the state of a specified process and of the process currently executed, respectively. Moreover, these macros ensure that the assignment operation is not mixed with other instructions by the compiler or the CPU control unit. Mixing the instruction order may sometimes lead to catastrophic results (see Chapter 5).

另外，内核还提供了两个宏set_task_state和set_current_state：分别设定一个指定的进程和当前正在执行的进程。更重要的是，这些宏保证编译器或CPU控制单元，不会将赋值操作和其它指令混合。有时候，混合的指令序会导致灾难性的后果（见[第5章](#5)）。

<h3 id="3.2.2">3.2.2 识别进程</h3>

As a general rule, each execution context that can be independently scheduled must have its own process descriptor; therefore, even lightweight processes, which share a large portion of their kernel data structures, have their own `task_struct` structures.

作为通用规则，每一个可以被独立调度的执行上下文都必须具有自己的进程描述符。因此，即使共享大部分的内核数据结构的轻进程，也都有自己的task_struct结构。

The strict one-to-one correspondence between the process and process descriptor makes the 32-bit address† of the `task_struct` structure a useful means for the kernel to identify processes. These addresses are referred to as process descriptor pointers. Most of the references to processes that the kernel makes are through process descriptor pointers.

因为进程和进程描述符之间严格遵循一对一原则，所以，可以使用task_struct结构体的32位地址作为标识进程的有用手段。这些地址被称为进程描述符指针。内核对进程的大多数引用都是通过进程描述符指针实现的。

On the other hand, Unix-like operating systems allow users to identify processes by means of a number called the Process ID (or PID), which is stored in the `pid` field of the process descriptor. PIDs are numbered sequentially: the PID of a newly created process is normally the PID of the previously created process increased by one. Of course, there is an upper limit on the PID values; when the kernel reaches such limit, it must start recycling the lower, unused PIDs. By default, the maximum PID number is 32,767 (PID_MAX_DEFAULT - 1); the system administrator may reduce this limit by writing a smaller value into the `/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max` file (`/proc` is the mount point of a special filesystem, see the section “Special Filesystems” in Chapter 12). In 64-bit architectures, the system administrator can enlarge the maximum PID number up to 4,194,303.

另一方面，类Unix操作系统提供了进程ID（PID）作为标识进程的一种手段，其存储在进程描述符的pid成员中。PID按顺序编号：新创建的进程ID通常是在前一个PID的基础上加1得到的结果。当然了，PID值有上限，当内核达到这个上限，它会回滚，重用未使用的PID号。默认情况下，PID的最大值是32767（PID_MAX_DEFAULT-1）；系统管理员可以减小这个值，方法就是写一个较小的值到/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max文件中（/proc是一个特殊文件系统挂载点，可以查看[第12章的特殊文件系统](12.3.1)一节）；在64位系统中，可以把这个值扩大到4194303。

When recycling PID numbers, the kernel must manage a `pidmap_array` bitmap that denotes which are the PIDs currently assigned and which are the free ones. Because a page frame contains 32,768 bits, in 32-bit architectures the `pidmap_array` bitmap is stored in a single page. In 64-bit architectures, however, additional pages can be added to the bitmap when the kernel assigns a PID number too large for the current bitmap size. These pages are never released.

为了重新回收利用PID号，内核必须知道哪些PID被使用，哪些是空闲的，它是通过一个pidmap_array的位图结构进行管理的。因为一个页帧刚好包含32768位，所以在32位架构里，pidmap_array位图被存储在一个单页中。在64位架构中，会添加额外的页到位图中，这样就可以保存更多的PID号。这些页永远不会被释放。

Linux associates a different PID with each process or lightweight process in the system. (As we shall see later in this chapter, there is a tiny exception on multiprocessor systems.) This approach allows the maximum flexibility, because every execution context in the system can be uniquely identified.

Linux为每一个进程或轻进程关联一个不同的PID（在本章的后面，我们可以多处理器系统中有细微的差异）。这种方法带来了最大程度的灵活性，因为系统中每一个执行上下文都可以被唯一标识。

On the other hand, Unix programmers expect threads in the same group to have a common PID. For instance, it should be possible to a send a signal specifying a PID that affects all threads in the group. In fact, the POSIX 1003.1c standard states that all threads of a multithreaded application must have the same PID.

另一方面，Unix编程者可能期望一组线程具有共同的PID。比如，它可能发送信号给指定的PID，而这个PID能够影响组内所有的线程。事实上，POSIX 1003.1c标准声明，多线程程序中的所有线程具有相同的PID。

To comply with this standard, Linux makes use of thread groups. The identifier shared by the threads is the PID of the thread group leader, that is, the PID of the first lightweight process in the group; it is stored in the tgid field of the process descriptors. The getpid() system call returns the value of tgid relative to the current process instead of the value of pid, so all the threads of a multithreaded application share the same identifier. Most processes belong to a thread group consisting of a single member; as thread group leaders, they have the tgid field equal to the pid field, thus the getpid() system call works as usual for this kind of process.

为了遵循这个标准，Linux使用了线程组的概念。所有线程共享的标识符是线程组组长的PID，也就是组内第一个轻进程的PID。它被存储在进程描述符tgid成员中。getpid()系统调用返回当前进程的tgid值而不是pid的值，所以，多线程程序中的所有线程共享同一个标识符。大部分进程属于单个线程构成的线程组；作为线程组的组长，它们的tgid值等于pid值，因而， getpid()系统调用对于这种进程可以正常工作。

Later, we’ll show you how it is possible to derive a true process descriptor pointer efficiently from its respective PID. Efficiency is important because many system calls such as kill() use the PID to denote the affected process.

稍后，我们将展示如何从各自的PID中有效地派生出一个真正的进程描述符。效率非常重要，因为许多系统调用，如kill()都会使用PID通知受影响的进程。

Processes are dynamic entities whose lifetimes range from a few milliseconds to months. Thus, the kernel must be able to handle many processes at the same time, and process descriptors are stored in dynamic memory rather than in the memory area permanently assigned to the kernel. For each process, Linux packs two different data structures in a single per-process memory area: a small data structure linked to the process descriptor, namely the `thread_info` structure, and the Kernel Mode process stack. The length of this memory area is usually 8,192 bytes (two page frames). For reasons of efficiency the kernel stores the 8-KB memory area in two consecutive page frames with the first page frame aligned to a multiple of 2^13; this may turn out to be a problem when little dynamic memory is available, because the free memory may become highly fragmented (see the section “The Buddy System Algorithm” in Chapter 8). Therefore, in the 80×86 architecture the kernel can be configured at compilation time so that the memory area including stack and `thread_info` structure spans a single page frame (4,096 bytes).

进程是一个动态的实体，它的生命周期从几毫秒到几个月。因而，内核必须能够同时处理多个进程，且进程描述符应该存储在动态内存区，而不是永久分配给内核的内存区。对于每个进程，Linux在它们的内存区打包了两个不同的数据结构：一个链接到进程描述符的小数据结构，又称为thread_info结构体；和内核态栈。这个区域的长度通常是8192字节（两个页帧）。因为效率的原因，内核分配连续的两个页帧，也就是第一个页帧的地址总是2^13的倍数。但是结果证明，分配小的动态内存时会带来问题，因为空闲的内存变得高度碎片化（参见第8章的[伙伴系统算法](#8.1.7)一节）。<font color="red">因此，在x86架构中，在编译时配置内核，使得包含栈和thread_info结构的内存区域跨越单个页帧（4096字节）。这句话的意思是说，可以从不是2^13的倍数地址分配这种内存吗？？？</font>

In the section “Segmentation in Linux” in Chapter 2, we learned that a process in Kernel Mode accesses a stack contained in the kernel data segment, which is different from the stack used by the process in User Mode. Because kernel control paths make little use of the stack, only a few thousand bytes of kernel stack are required. Therefore, 8 KB is ample space for the stack and the `thread_info` structure. However, when stack and `thread_info` structure are contained in a single page frame, the kernel uses a few additional stacks to avoid the overflows caused by deeply nested interrupts and exceptions (see Chapter 4).

在第二章的[Linux分段]()一节中，我们已经了解，内核态访问的包含在内核数据段中的栈，和用户态进程使用的栈是不同的。因为内核的控制路径很少使用栈，只需要几千字节的内核栈。因此，8KB的内存空间对于栈和thread_info结构来说足够了。但是，当栈和thread_info结构包含在单个页帧中时，内核使用一些额外的栈去避免由于深度嵌套中断和异常可能造成的溢出（参见[第4章](#4)）。

Figure 3-2 shows how the two data structures are stored in the 2-page (8 KB) memory area. The `thread_info` structure resides at the beginning of the memory area, and the stack grows downward from the end. The figure also shows that the `thread_info` structure and the `task_struct` structure are mutually linked by means of the fields `task` and `thread_info`, respectively.

图3-2展示了两个数据结构在8KB内存区是如何分布的。thread_info结构位于这块内存的开始，而栈是向下增长的。图中还展示了thread_info和task_struct两个结构之间的相互链接关系，分别通过task和thread_info两个成员实现。

<img id="Figure_3-2" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_3_2.PNG">

图3-2 thread_info结构和进程内核栈在连续两个页帧的布局

The `esp` register is the CPU stack pointer, which is used to address the stack’s top location. On 80×86 systems, the stack starts at the end and grows toward the beginning of the memory area. Right after switching from User Mode to Kernel Mode, the kernel stack of a process is always empty, and therefore the `esp` register points to the byte immediately following the stack.

esp寄存器是CPU栈指针，用来寻址栈顶位置。x86系统中，栈位于高地址，向下增长。刚刚从用户态切换到内核态时，进程的内核栈总是空的，esp寄存器总是指向紧跟栈后的字节处。

The value of the `esp` is decreased as soon as data is written into the stack. Because the `thread_info` structure is 52 bytes long, the kernel stack can expand up to 8,140 bytes.

只要数据写入栈中，esp的值将会被减。因为thread_info结构体的大小是52个字节，内核栈能够扩展到8140个字节。

The C language allows the `thread_info` structure and the kernel stack of a process to be conveniently represented by means of the following union construct:

使用union联合类型结构实现thread_info和进程内核栈的结构：

    union thread_union {
        struct thread_info thread_info;
        unsigned long stack[2048];          /* 1024是4KB大小 */
    };

The `thread_info` structure shown in Figure 3-2 is stored starting at address 0x015fa000, and the stack is stored starting at address 0x015fc000. The value of the `esp` register points to the current top of the stack at 0x015fa878.

图3-2中，thread_info结构体的开始地址是0x015fa000，栈的开始地址是0x015fc000。esp寄存器的值是指向当前栈顶位置0x015fa878的指针。

The kernel uses the `alloc_thread_info` and `free_thread_info` macros to allocate and release the memory area storing a `thread_info` structure and a kernel stack.

内核使用alloc_thread_info和free_thread_info两个宏，为thread_info和栈，分配和释放内存区域。

<h4 id="3.2.2.2">3.2.2.2 标识当前进程</h4>

<s>
The close association between the `thread_info` structure and the Kernel Mode stack just described offers a key benefit in terms of efficiency: the kernel can easily obtain the address of the `thread_info` structure of the process currently running on a CPU from the value of the `esp` register. In fact, if the `thread_union` structure is 8 KB (2^13 bytes) long, the kernel masks out the 13 least significant bits of `esp` to obtain the base address of the `thread_info` structure; on the other hand, if the `thread_union` structure is 4 KB long, the kernel masks out the 12 least significant bits of `esp`. This is done by the `current_thread_info() `function, which produces assembly language instructions like the following:

正如刚刚描述的，thread_info结构和内核栈这种紧密的联系，从效率上讲，提供了一个重要的优点：内核可以轻松从esp指针中获取正在运行进程的thread_info结构的地址。如下面的代码所示，因为thread_union联合体的大小是8K，所以屏蔽掉栈esp寄存器的低13位，就能获取的thread_info的基地址。

    movl $0xffffe000,%ecx /* or 0xfffff000 for 4KB stacks */
    andl %esp,%ecx
    movl %ecx,p

After executing these three instructions, p contains the `thread_info` structure pointer of the process running on the CPU that executes the instruction.

执行完这3条指令后，p就是thread_info结构体的指针。

Most often the kernel needs the address of the process descriptor rather than the address of the thread_info structure. To get the process descriptor pointer of the process currently running on a CPU, the kernel makes use of the current macro, which is essentially equivalent to `current_thread_info()->task` and produces assembly language instructions like the following:

大部分时候，内核需要的是进程描述符的地址而不是thread_info结构体的地址。为了获取当前正在运行的进程的进程描述符的指针，内核使用current宏，等价于`current_thread_info()->task`，产生的汇编指令跟上面的代码类似。

    movl $0xffffe000,%ecx /* or 0xfffff000 for 4KB stacks */
    andl %esp,%ecx
    movl (%ecx),p

Because the task field is at offset 0 in the thread_info structure, after executing these three instructions p contains the process descriptor pointer of the process running on the CPU.

因为task是thread_info结构体的第一个成员，偏移量为0，所以执行完这些指令之后，p就是进程描述符的指针。

The current macro often appears in kernel code as a prefix to fields of the process descriptor. For example, current->pid returns the process ID of the process currently running on the CPU.

Another advantage of storing the process descriptor with the stack emerges on multiprocessor systems: the correct current process for each hardware processor can be derived just by checking the stack, as shown previously. Earlier versions of Linux did not store the kernel stack and the process descriptor together. Instead, they were forced to introduce a global static variable called current to identify the process descriptor of the running process. On multiprocessor systems, it was necessary to define current as an array—one element for each available CPU.

<h4 id="3.2.2.3">3.2.2.3 双向链表</h4>

Before moving on and describing how the kernel keeps track of the various processes in the system, we would like to emphasize the role of special data structures that implement doubly linked lists.

在我们讨论内核如何追踪各种进程之前，我们先来看一个特殊的数据结构，`双向链表`。

For each list, a set of primitive operations must be implemented: initializing the list, inserting and deleting an element, scanning the list, and so on. It would be both a waste of programmers’ efforts and a waste of memory to replicate the primitive operations for each different list.

内核中肯定存在着大量表，方便管理数据。但是对于这些表的每一种操作必须实现为原子操作：初始化、插入/删除元素、遍历列表等等。而为这些表重复实现原子操作，不仅是编程者精力的一种浪费，也会更加消耗内存。

Therefore, the Linux kernel defines the `list_head` data structure, whose only fields `next` and `prev` represent the forward and back pointers of a generic doubly linked list element, respectively. It is important to note, however, that the pointers in a `list_head` field store the addresses of other `list_head` fields rather than the addresses of the whole data structures in which the `list_head` structure is included; see Figure 3-3 (a).

因此，Linux内核定义了`list_head`链表结构，只有2个成员`next`和`prev`指针，分别是链表结构前后元素的索引。但是，值得注意的是，`list_head`里的指针指向的是其它`list_head`结构的地址，而不是包含`list_head`结构的整个数据结构的地址，见图3-3（a）。

A new list is created by using the `LIST_HEAD`(list_name) macro. It declares a new variable named list_name of type `list_head`, which is a dummy first element that acts as a placeholder for the head of the new list, and initializes the prev and next fields of the `list_head` data structure so as to point to the list_name variable itself; see Figure 3-3 (b).

可以使用宏`LIST_HEAD(list_name)`创建新的`list_head`列表，名称是`list_name`。它的第一个元素是空的，其占位符的作用，并初始化`next`和`prev`指针指向自己，见图3-3（b）

<img id="Figure_3-3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_3_3.PNG">

图3-3 内嵌着`list_head`数据结构的双向链表

Several functions and macros implement the primitives, including those shown in Table 3-1.

下表是一些操作函数和宏，实现是原子的。

<img id="Figure_3_1_T" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_3_1_T.PNG">

The Linux kernel 2.6 sports another kind of doubly linked list, which mainly differs from a `list_head` list because it is not circular; it is mainly used for hash tables, where space is important, and finding the the last element in constant time is not. The list head is stored in an hlist_head data structure, which is simply a pointer to the first element in the list (NULL if the list is empty). Each element is represented by an hlist_node data structure, which includes a pointer `next` to the next element, and a pointer `pprev` to the `next` field of the previous element. Because the list is not circular, the `pprev` field of the first element and the `next` field of the last element are set to NULL. The list can be handled by means of several helper functions and macros similar to those listed in Table 3-1: hlist_add_head(), hlist_del(), hlist_empty(), hlist_entry, hlist_for_each_entry, and so on.

从Linux 2.6版本开始，还支持另外一种双向链表，但它不是环形链表。这种链表有两种数据结构`hlist_head`和`hlist_node`，其主要用于哈希表（hash），空间很重要，但是查找最后一个元素的时间复杂度不是O(1)。`hlist_head`是指向链表表头的指针，如果链表是空的，则其成员first指针等于null。链表中每个元素使用`hlist_node`结构表示，`hlist_node`包含2个指针，指向下一个元素的`next`指针和指向前一个元素的`next`指针的`pprev`指针。由于不是环形结构，链表中第一个元素的`pprev`指针指向表头的`first`指针，最后一个元素的`next`指针设为null。这种hash链表结构也有类似于`list_head`那样的处理函数和宏：hlist_add_head()、hlist_del()、hlist_empty()、hlist_entry、hlist_for_each_entry等等。

<h4 id="3.2.2.4">3.2.2.4 进程列表</h4>

The first example of a doubly linked list we will examine is the process list, a list that links together all existing process descriptors. Each `task_struct` structure includes a tasks field of type `list_head` whose `prev` and `next` fields point, respectively, to the previous and to the next task_struct element.

我们将研究的第一个双向链表的结构是进程表，也就是把所有已存在的进程描述符串起来的链表。如果查看linux内核源代码，会发现每一个`task_struct`中都包含`struct list_head`类型的`tasks`成员，它的prev和next指针分别指向前一个和后一个task_struct结构。

The head of the process list is the init_task task_struct descriptor; it is the process descriptor of the so-called process 0 or swapper (see the section “Kernel Threads” later in this chapter). The tasks->prev field of init_task points to the tasks field of the process descriptor inserted last in the list.

该进程链表的头是一个叫`init_task`的进程描述符，它是所谓的进程0或swapper（参见本章后面的"[内核线程](#3.4.2)"一节）的进程描述符。`init_task`的`tasks->prev`指向最后插入该链表的进程描述符的`tasks`成员。

The SET_LINKS and REMOVE_LINKS macros are used to insert and to remove a process descriptor in the process list, respectively. These macros also take care of the parenthood relationship of the process (see the section “How Processes Are Organized” later in this chapter).

内核提供了简单操作进程列表的专用宏`SET_LINKS`和`REMOVE_LINKS`，分别用来插入和删除一个进程描述符。这些宏还负责处理进程的父子关系（参见本章后面的"[进程是如何组织的](#3.2.4)"一节）。

Another useful macro, called for_each_process, scans the whole process list. It is defined as:

其它有用的宏，比如`for_each_process`，遍历整个进程列表。定义如下：

    #define for_each_process(p) \
        for (p=&init_task; (p=list_entry((p)->tasks.next, \
                                struct task_struct, tasks) \
                                ) != &init_task; )

The macro is the loop control statement after which the kernel programmer supplies the loop. Notice how the init_task process descriptor just plays the role of list header. The macro starts by moving past init_task to the next task and continues until it reaches init_task again (thanks to the circularity of the list). At each iteration, the variable passed as the argument of the macro contains the address of the currently scanned process descriptor, as returned by the list_entry macro.

宏展开后，就是一个for循环。可以注意的是，`init_task`进程描述符仅仅是扮演了一个链表表头的作用。该宏就是把`init_task`传递给下一个任务，直到再次转到`init_task`（因为是环形链表）。每一次的迭代过程中，通过宏传递进来的参数`p`都会被`list_entry`宏的值赋值，等于当前扫描到的进程描述符的地址。

<h4 id="3.2.2.5">3.2.2.5 运行态进程列表</h4>

When looking for a new process to run on a CPU, the kernel has to consider only the runnable processes (that is, the processes in the TASK_RUNNING state).

当我们要查找将要在CPU上运行的进程时，必须只考虑在运行态的进程（也就是说处于`TASK_RUNNING`状态的进程）

Earlier Linux versions put all runnable processes in the same list called runqueue. Because it would be too costly to maintain the list ordered according to process priorities, the earlier schedulers were compelled to scan the whole list in order to select the “best” runnable process.

早期的linux内核把所有可运行的进程存放在一个称为`runqueue`的链表中。因为按照进程优先级分别组织链表的话，维护成本太高，早期的内核调度器被迫遍历整个链表，以便选出最好的可运行进程。

Linux 2.6 implements the runqueue differently. The aim is to allow the scheduler to select the best runnable process in constant time, independently of the number of runnable processes. We’ll defer to Chapter 7 a detailed description of this new kind of runqueue, and we’ll provide here only some basic information.

从Linux 2.6版本之后的内核实现不同的`runqueue`。目的就是可以在恒定时间内选出最佳的可运行进程，而无关于可运行进程的数量。详细的阐述会在[第7章](#7)介绍，这儿只是提供基本的概念。

The trick used to achieve the scheduler speedup consists of splitting the runqueue in many lists of runnable processes, one list per process priority. Each task_struct descriptor includes a run_list field of type list_head. If the process priority is equal to k (a value ranging between 0 and 139), the run_list field links the process descriptor into the list of runnable processes having priority k. Furthermore, on a multiprocessor system, each CPU has its own runqueue, that is, its own set of lists of processes. This is a classic example of making a data structures more complex to improve performance: to make scheduler operations more efficient, the runqueue list has been split into 140 different lists!

让调度器加速的小技巧就是将可运行的进程按照优先级分割成多个链表，每个链表对应一个优先级。每个`task_struct`结构中包含一个`list_head`类型的`run_list`成员。假设进程优先级等于k（范围0-139），run_list就相当于把具有优先级k的可运行进程连接起来组成一个链表。进一步，如果是多核系统，每个CPU都有自己的runqueue，也就是自己的一组进程链表。这是增加数据结构的复杂度，以提高性能的经典案例：为了是调度器更加高效，将runqueue分割成140个不同的链表！

As we’ll see, the kernel must preserve a lot of data for every runqueue in the system; however, the main data structures of a runqueue are the lists of process descriptors belonging to the runqueue; all these lists are implemented by a single `prio_array_t` data structure, whose fields are shown in Table 3-2.

正如我们看到的，内核必须为系统中的每一个runqueue保存大量的数据。但是，runqueue中主要的数据结构还是属于它的进程描述符的链表；这些链表是通过一个数组结构prio_array_t实现的。

表 3-2 prio_array_t数据结构的各个成员

<img id="Figure_3_2_T" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_3_2_T.PNG">

The enqueue_task(p,array) function inserts a process descriptor into a runqueue list; its code is essentially equivalent to:

    list_add_tail(&p->run_list, &array->queue[p->prio]);
    __set_bit(p->prio, array->bitmap);
    array->nr_active++;
    p->array = array;

The prio field of the process descriptor stores the dynamic priority of the process, while the array field is a pointer to the `prio_array_t` data structure of its current runqueue. Similarly, the `dequeue_task(p,array)` function removes a process descriptor from a runqueue list.

<font color="blue">补充：

这一部分的内容，从原理上来说，新旧内核类似的。但是，在Linux4.4.23版本中，任务优先级已经被分为2组，0-99为实时调度进程优先级；100-139为普通进程优先级（也就是用户态进程）。实时进程的优先级当然要高于普通进程的优先级。

根据这种划分，内核的调度方法也分为了2种：完全公平调度(cfs)和实时调度(rt)。因为它们的调度方法不同，内核为了调度器的统一处理，使用类似于面向对象的概念，抽象出一个调度类(struct sched_class)，声明了统一的回调函数接口。具体的接口则分别由公平调度实例(fair_sched_class)和实时调度实例(rt_sched_class)实现。

数据结构`prio_array_t`已经改成了

    struct rt_prio_array {
        DECLARE_BITMAP(bitmap, MAX_RT_PRIO+1); /* include 1 bit for delimiter */
        struct list_head queue[MAX_RT_PRIO];
    };

对于向runqueue队列中插入一个进程描述符的函数`enqueue_task(p,array)`也已经修改为

    void (*enqueue_task) (struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p, int flags);

具体的实现由各个实例实现。

<h3 id="3.2.3">3.2.3 进程之间关系</h3>

我们已经或多或少知道，进程具有父子关系，不仅如此，还有兄弟关系。所以，进程描述符中必须有几个成员是记录这种关系的（P是创建的进程），具体可以参考下表。进程0和1是由内核创建的，后面我们会看到，进程1（init）是所有其它进程的祖先。

表3-3 进程中用来表述父子、兄弟关系的成员

| 成员名称 | 描述 |
| -------- | ---- |
| real_parent | 指向创建P，如果不存在指向进程1。（比如，在shell中启动了一个后台进程，然后退出shell，则后台进程的父进程就是init）。|
| parent      | 指向P的当前父进程。（当子进程结束时，必须发送信号通知的那个进程）；通常等于real_parent。偶尔会有不同的时候，比如当另一个进程发送ptrace()系统调用去监控进程P时（具体可以查看第20章的[执行跟踪](#20.1.5)）。|
| children    | 包含P创建的所有子进程的列表的表头。|
| sibling     | 包含指向兄弟关系的进程链表中的下一个元素和前一个元素的指针，这些进程的父进程都是P。|

图3-4 阐述了进程的父子、兄弟关系。进程P0以此创建了P1、P2和P3。继而，进程P3创建了P4。

更进一步讲，进程之间还有其它关系：一个进程可以是进程组的组长或者login会话的组长（参见第一章的进程管理），还可以是线程组的组长（参见本章前面的[标识进程](#3.2.2)），还可以追踪其它进程的执行（参见第20章的[执行跟踪](#20.1.5)）。表3-4列出了描述进程P和其它进程之间关系的数据成员。

表3-4 进程描述符中建立非父子兄弟关系的数据成员

| 成员名称 | 描述 |
| -------- | ---- |
| group_leader    | 进程P的进程组组长的进程描述符 |
| signal->pgrp    | 进程P的进程组组长的PID |
| tgid            | 进程P的线程组组长的PID |
| signal->session | 进程P的login会话组组长的PID |
| ptrace_children | 正在被调试器追踪的进程P的所有子进程的列表的表头 |
| ptrace_list     | 包含指向正在被调试器追踪所有进程的real_parent列表中的元素的指针，分别指向下一个或者前一个元素。当追踪进程P时使用。|

<h4 id="3.2.3.1">3.2.3.1 PID哈希表和链表</h4>

在多种情况下，内核必须能够根据PID得到进程描述符的指针。比如，kill()系统调用，假设进程P1想要发送给进程P2一个信号，它指定P2进程的PID作为参数调用kill()。内核能够根据PID溯源到进程描述符的指针，然后从P2的进程描述符记录待处理（也就是挂起-pending）信号的数据结构的指针。

顺序扫描进程列表，逐个检查进程描述符的pid成员，这当然是可行的，但却不是最有效的。为了加速查找过程，内核引入了4个哈希表。为什么是4个哈希表呢？这当然是因为进程描述符的PID有4类，如表3-5所示，每一种PID对应一个哈希表。

表3-5 进程描述符中的四种哈希表以及对应的数据结构

| 哈希表类型 | 成员名称 | 描述 |
| ---------- | -------- | ---- |
| PIDTYPE_PID | pid     | 进程PID |
| PIDTYPE_TGID| tgid    | 线程组组长的PID |
| PIDTYPE_PGID| pgrp    | 进程组组长的PID |
| PIDTYPE_SID | session | session组长的PID |

4个哈希表都是在内核初始化阶段动态分配，它们的地址存储在pid_hash的数组中。哈希表的大小依赖于RAM的数量。比如，系统的RAM位512M，每一个哈希表被存储在4个页帧中，大约是2048项（4*4*1024/4/2=2048）。

使用pid_hashfn宏将PID值转换成哈希表的索引值，其定义为：

    #define pid_hashfn(x) hash_long((unsigned long) x, pidhash_shift)

其中，pidhash_shift参数是哈希表索引所占的位数，在我们的例子中需要2048项，也就是2^11，所以pidhash_shift=11。hash_long()函数被许多哈希函数使用；对于32位架构等于：

    unsigned long hash_long(unsigned long val, unsigned int bits)
    {
        unsigned long hash = val * 0x9e370001UL;
        return hash >> (32 - bits);
    }

因为在我们的示例中，pidhash_shift等于11，所以pid_hashfn宏产生的值永远落在0-2047这个区间内。

> 魔幻常数
>
> 在上面的代码中，你肯定会想0x9e370001UL这个值是如何得来的。hash函数通常是索引值乘以一个合适的大数，因此，结果会溢出，将其余下的值存入32位的变量，这个变量可以看做是求模运算的结果。Knuth认为，选取一段数值范围中黄金比例的质数为这个大数是最合适的。所以，0-2^23之间的黄金比例附近最合适的质数，我们选取0x9e370001UL，它还可以方便地被加、减法，还有移位实现。因为它等于`2^31 + 2^29 - 2^25 + 2^22 - 2^19 – 2^16 + 1`。

正如计算机科学课程中所讲的，哈希函数是无法保证PID和哈希表索引之间的一对一关系的。两个PID对应哈希表中的同一个索引，就成为 *冲突*。

为了解决这个冲突问题，Linux决定使用一个双向链表存储这些冲突的PID，把这个双向链表的表头存入哈希表中，通过这种方法，完美地解决了这个冲突。图3-5，展示了一个带有两个双向链表的PID哈希表：PID为2890和29384的进程都被存入到哈希表的第200个元素处的双向链表中，而PID为29385的进程被装入到了哈希表的第1466个元素里。

这种带链表的哈希表优于从PID到表索引的线性转换，这是因为，对于任何给定的32位系统中，进程的数量通常远少于32768个（最大允许进程数）。如果定义一个32768项的表，这对于内存空间都是一种浪费，因为大部分项根本没用。

当然了，实际用在PID哈希表中的数据结构非常复杂，因为它们要跟踪进程之间的各种关系。比如，假设内核需要检索属于某个线程组的所有进程，也就是所有的进程其tgid成员都等于某个相同的进程ID。如果根据这个给定的线程组ID，也就是线程组组长的PID，遍历整个PID哈希表，仅是返回一个进程描述符，也就是线程组组长的进程描述符。那为了快速检索整个线程组的所有进程，内核就需要为每个线程组维护一个进程表。对于寻找一个给定的login会话组或者进程组中的所有进程，道理是一样的。

<img id="Figure_3_5" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_3_5.PNG">

Figure 3-5. 一个简单的PID哈希表和链表

PID哈希表的数据结构就解决了这所有的问题，因为它允许给包含在哈希表中的任何一个PID定义一个进程表。核心数据结构就是在进程描述符的pids成员中嵌入4个pid成员结构，组成一个数组，数组每个成员对应一种哈希表。每个pid成员的数据成员如表3-6所示：

表3-6 `pid`数据结构的各个成员

| 类型              | 名称      | 描述 |
| ----------------- | --------- | ---- |
| int               | nr        | PID值 |
| struct hlist_node | pid_chain | 用于hash表中的链表结构中，用于指向下一个和前一个元素 |
| struct list_head  | pid_list  | 每个PID表的头 |

我们用下面的图3-6，展示一个类型为PIDTYPE_TGID的哈希表。pid_hash数组的第二项存储着哈希表的地址，也就是由hlist_head结构的组成的一个数组，这个数组存储着链表的表头。开始于哈希表第71项的链表，存储着2个进程描述符，其PID分别是246和4351，使用双向链表表示。这些PID值存储在进程描述符的pid结构成员的nr成员中（顺便说一下，因为线程组的ID和它的组长的PID相同，所以这些值也是线程组的ID）。接下来，我们看一个线程组4351，它对应着一组链表：链表的头被存储在进程描述符的pid_list结构成员中，通过pid_list结构的next和prev指针分别指向该链表的下一个和前一个元素。通过这种方式，我们就实现了检索某个线程组中的所有进程。其它3类哈希表的检索与此类似，就不再一一展开了。

图3-6展示了一个基于PIDTYPE_TGID类型的哈希表的示例。pid_hash数组中的第2项存储着该哈希表的地址，也就是hlist_head类型的数组结构，用于保存具有相同tpid值的链表的表头。tgid哈希表的第71项出来的分链表中，有PID分别为246和4351的进程描述符。

<img id="Figure_3_6" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_3_6.PNG">

图3-6 PID哈希表

下面的函数和宏用来处理PID哈希表：

* do_each_task_pid(nr, type, task)
* while_each_task_pid(nr, type, task)

    遍历与nr指定的PID相关的每一个PID列表，type是哈希表类型，task指向当前刚被遍历过的进程描述符。

* find_task_by_pid_type(type, nr)

    type类型的哈希表中查找PID等于nr的进程。函数返回匹配的进程描述符指针，如果不匹配返回NULL。

* find_task_by_pid(nr)

    作用等同于find_task_by_pid_type(PIDTYPE_PID, nr)。

* attach_pid(task, type, nr)

    往类型为type的PID哈希表中插入进程描述符，task指向要插入的进程描述符，nr是PID哈希表的索引。如果已经有一个PID等于nr的进程描述符在哈希表中了，则将task插入到该PID对应的链表中。

* detach_pid(task, type)

    从类型为type的PID列表中删除task指向的进程描述符。执行完删除操作后，如果PID链表没有变为空，则函数执行中止；否则，该函数还会从类型为type的哈希表中删除对应的进程描述符。

* next_thread(task)

    返回类型为PIDTYPE_TGID的哈希表中紧跟在task之后的轻进程的进程描述符地址。因为链表是环形的，如果是作用到常规进程上，该宏返回进程本身的描述符地址。


<h3 id="3.2.4">3.2.4 如何组织进程</h3>

使用runqueue列表组织所有运行态（TASK_RUNNING）的进程。对于其它状态下的进程，根据类型不同做不同的处理。下面是处理的基本原则：

* 处于TASK_STOPPED、EXIT_ZOMBIE或EXIT_DEAD等终止态的进程不需要使用特定列表进行管理。因为终止态的进程只能通过PID或者通过特定父进程的子进程链表进行查找。

* 而处于TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE或TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE状态的进程被细分为许多类，每一类对应一种event。对于这种情况，内核必须在进程描述符中提供一种数据结构，用于管理这类进程信息。我们称这些额外的数据结构为等待队列。

<h4 id="3.2.4.1">3.2.4.1 等待队列</h4>

等待队列在内核中有多种用途，特别是进行中断处理，进程同步和定时处理时，非常有用。在这儿，我们只讨论进程等待某些事件发生，比如硬盘操作终止，系统资源被释放，或timeout等事件。等待队列实现条件等待某些事件：进程等待某个事件，把自己暂时存入某个等待队列中，放弃对CPU的控制权；当等待的条件发生后，会被内核唤醒。

等待队列使用双向链表实现，包含指向进程描述符的指针。每个等待队列都有一个表头，数据类型为wait_queue_head_t，其定义如下：

    struct __wait_queue_head {
        spinlock_t lock;
        struct list_head task_list;
    };
    typedef struct __wait_queue_head wait_queue_head_t;

因为等待队列可能同时被中断处理或内核函数修改，必须对这个双向链表实行加锁处理，防止并发情况的出现，从而产生不可预知的后果（参见[第5章](#5)）。等待队列中，使用的是自旋锁lock，其类型是spinlock_t。而成员task_list是等待进程的链表的表头。

等待队列中的元素类型为wait_queue_t，其定义如下：

    struct __wait_queue {
        unsigned int        flags;
        struct task_struct  *task;
        wait_queue_func_t   func;
        struct list_head    task_list;
    };
    typedef struct __wait_queue wait_queue_t;

等待队列中的每一个元素表示一个正在休眠的进程，它正在等待某些事件的发生；其进程描述符的地址存储在task成员中。类型为list_head的成员task_list包含指向这个链表中其它元素的指针。

但是，唤醒等待队列中所有的休眠进程，多数时候可能不方便。比如，如果有多于2个进程正在等待某些资源，并进行独占式访问，这种情况下，应该只唤醒其中一个进程，允许其占用资源，而其它进程继续休眠。（这避免了 *惊群效应*的出现，所谓的惊群效应就是多个进程被唤醒，只为了竞争一个资源，而这个资源只能被其中一个访问，结果就是其余的进程再次被休眠。）

因此，这就产生了两种休眠进程：独占式进程（等待队列中该进程的flags相应标志位被置1）和非独占进程（标志位被清零），当事件发生时，独占式进程有选择地被唤醒，非独占式进程总是全被唤醒。等待每次只能分配给一个进程使用的资源的进程，就是独占式进程；否则，就是非独占式。比如，一组进程正在等待硬盘传输完成的事件，一旦传输完成，所有等待的进程立即被唤醒。接下来，我们看看wait_queue_t中的func成员是如何将等待队列中休眠的进程唤醒的。

<h4 id="3.2.4.2">3.2.4.2 处理等待队列</h4>

1. 初始化

    声明等待队列表头，使用宏DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD(name)，静态声明一个名称为name的变量并初始化lock和task_list成员。init_waitqueue_head()函数动态创建一个等待队列表头变量并完成初始化。

    函数init_waitqueue_entry(q,p)初始化等待队列中的一项，q的类型是wait_queue_t，代码内容如下：

        q->flags = 0;
        q->task = p;
        q->func = default_wake_function;

    非独占式进程P将会被default_wake_function()函数唤醒，该函数是try_to_wake_up()函数的封装函数，具体可以参考[第7章](#7)。

    另外，DEFINE_WAIT声明一个新的wait_queue_t变量，并使用当前正在运行的进程描述符初始化它，而func成员被初始化为autoremove_wake_function()唤醒函数。这个函数调用default_wake_function()唤醒正在休眠的地址，然后从等待队列中删除这个进程。最后，内核开发者可以init_waitqueue_func_entry()函数可以自定义一个唤醒函数。

2. 插入等待队列

    将进程插入等待队列中，可以使用的函数有：

    * add_wait_queue()

        将非独占进程插入到等待队列的第一个位置处。

    * add_wait_queue_exclusive()

        将独占进程插入到等待队列的最后位置处。

    * remove_wait_queue()

        从队列中移除一个进程。

    * waitqueue_active()

        检查等待队列是否为空

3. 休眠

    想要等待某个条件的进程，可以调用下面任何一个函数进入休眠状态：

    - sleep_on()

        sleep_on()函数直接操作当前进程：

            void sleep_on(wait_queue_head_t *wq)
            {
                wait_queue_t wait;
                init_waitqueue_entry(&wait, current);
                current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
                add_wait_queue(wq,&wait);               /* 指向等待队列的表头 */
                schedule();
                remove_wait_queue(wq, &wait);
            }

        函数设置当前进程的状态为TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE，并把它插入到指定的等待队列中。然后调用调度器，继续其它进程的执行。当休眠的进程被唤醒时，调度器继续sleep_on()函数的执行，执行`remove_wait_queue(wq, &wait);`这条语句，将进程从等待队列中删除。

    - interruptible_sleep_on()

        与sleep_on()函数相同，唯一的不同是，将进程的状态设为TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE，这表示进程可以被信号唤醒，比如中止信号等等。

    - sleep_on_timeout()
    - interruptible_sleep_on_timeout()

        这两个函数和前面的2个函数非常类似，只是允许调用者可以定义个时间间隔，如果定时时间到，则进程被内核唤醒。实现方式就是使用schedule_timeout()函数代替schedule()函数。

    - prepare_to_wait()
    - prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
    - finish_wait()

        这几个函数是在内核2.6版本中引入的，提供了一些其它休眠进程的方法。它们的使用方式，通常如下：

            DEFINE_WAIT(wait);
            prepare_to_wait_exclusive(&wq, &wait, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
                                        /* wq 等待队列的表头 */
            ...
            if (!condition)
                schedule();
            finish_wait(&wq, &wait);

        prepare_to_wait()和prepare_to_wait_exclusive()函数设置进程的状态为第三个参数传递进来的值，然后设置等待队列中的进程的独占标志，0-非独占，1-独占，然后插入到等待队列中，wq是等待队列的表头。

        只要进程被唤醒，继续执行finish_wait()函数，再次将进程的状态设为TASK_RUNNING状态，从等待队列中删除该进程。（这儿有个需要注意的问题就是，condition必须在schedule()之前变为true。

    - wait_event
    - wait_event_interruptible

        等待某个条件被验证，否则一直休眠。wait_event(wq,condition)的代码与下面的内容类似：

            DEFINE_WAIT(__wait);
            for (;;) {
                prepare_to_wait(&wq, &__wait, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
                if (condition)
                    break;
                schedule();
            }
            finish_wait(&wq, &__wait);

    我们发现，当需要测试某个条件，判断条件不能被验证时，将进程休眠且该操作必须是原子的，这种环境下，是无法使用类sleep_on()函数的。这种情况下是会产生竞态条件的，这种使用是不鼓励的。更主要的是，为了往等待队列中插入一个独占进程，内核必须使用prepare_to_wait_exclusive()或者直接调用add_wait_queue_exclusive()。其它的插入等待队列的函数都是非独占的。最后，使用DEFINE_WAIT或者finish_wait()将唤醒的进程从等待队列中删除。

4. 唤醒

    内核唤醒等待队列中的进程后，将它们设为运行态。可调用的方法有wake_up、wake_up_nr、wake_up_all、wake_up_interruptible、wake_up_interruptible_nr、wake_up_interruptible_all、wake_up_interruptible_sync、和wake_up_locked。基本上，从名字就可以看出它们的用处：

    * 所有的宏都可唤醒处于TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE状态的休眠进程；如果宏名称不包含interruptible的宏，也能唤醒TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE状态的进程。

    * 所有的宏都可以唤醒所要求的状态下的非独占进程

    * 包含nr字符串的宏，唤醒所要求的状态下的独占进程，nr就是指定PID

    * 不包含sync的宏会检查被唤醒进程的优先级是否高于当前正在运行的进程，如果有必要调用schedule()，将正在运行的进程休眠。包含sync的宏，不会执行优先级检查，这样的结果就是，高优先级的进程可能会有一定的延时。

    * wake_up_locked宏与wake_up相似，不同的是，它可以在wait_queue_head_t中的自旋锁已经被占用的情况下调用。

    比如，宏wake_up的代码大概是下面这样的：

        void wake_up(wait_queue_head_t *q)
        {
            struct list_head *tmp;
            wait_queue_t *curr;

            list_for_each(tmp, &q->task_list) {
                curr = list_entry(tmp, wait_queue_t, task_list);
                if (curr->func(curr, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE|TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE,
                        0, NULL) && curr->flags)
                    break;
            }
        }

    遍历q指向的双向链表q->task_list中所有的进程。对于每一项，list_entry计算wait_queue_t类型的变量的地址。这个变量的func成员存储着唤醒函数的地址。如果进程被唤醒，且如果进程是独占的（curr->flags=1），则循环终止。因为所有的非独占进程都存储在链表的开头部分，所有的独占进程都在链表的尾端，该函数总是唤醒所有的非独占进程，然后唤醒一个独占进程，如果存在的话。

<h3 id="3.2.5">3.2.5 进程资源限制</h3>

每个进程都需要进行资源限制，避免把系统搞垮（比如对CPU的使用，硬盘空间的占用等等）。基于这个目的，Linux内核在每个进程的进程描述符中还应该包含资源限制的数据结构，Linux使用了一个数组成员，该数组成员的包含关系为current->signal->rlim，数组的定义如下所示：

    struct rlimit rlim[RLIM_NLIMITS];

其中，rlimit结构的定义为：

    struct rlimit {
        __kernel_ulong_t    rlim_cur;
        __kernel_ulong_t    rlim_max;
    };

__kernel_ulong_t等于无符号长整形。RLIM_NLIMITS的大小为16，也就是说，目前对进程资源的限制有16种，分别如下所示：

1. RLIMIT_AS

    进程空间的最大值，单位是字节。当进程使用malloc()或者相关函数扩大自己的地址空间时，就会检查这个值。

2. RLIMIT_CORE

    最大核心转储文件大小，单位是字节。当进程被中止时，内核会检查这个值，然后进程的当前目录下创建一个core文件。（最常见的情况就是，我们的程序有bug而崩溃的时候，会在该目录下产生一个core文件。）当然了，如果这个值的大小为0，是不会产生core文件的。

3. RLIMIT_CPU

    进程占用CPU的最大时间，单位是秒（S）。如果超过这个时间，内核会发送一个SIGXCPU信号，如果进程还是没有终止，再发送SIGKILL信号。

4. RLIMIT_DATA

    最大堆大小，单位是字节。内核在扩大进程的堆空间之前，检查这个值。

5. RLIMIT_FSIZE

    最大文件大小，单位是字节。如果进程尝试扩大文件超过这个值，内核发送一个SIGXFSZ信号。

6. RLIMIT_LOCKS

    文件锁的最大数量（目前不强制）。

7. RLIMIT_MEMLOCK

    非交换内存的最大值，单位是字节。当内核调用mlock()或mlockall()系统调用尝试给一个页帧加锁时会检查该值。

8. RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE

    POSIX消息队列的最大字节数。

9. RLIMIT_NOFILE

    打开的文件描述符最大数量。当新打开一个文件或复制文件描述符时，内核都会检查这个值。

10. RLIMIT_NPROC

    用户可以拥有的最大进程数量。

11. RLIMIT_RSS

    进程可以拥有的页帧数量，也就是物理帧的数量（目前不强制）。

12. RLIMIT_SIGPENDING

    进程挂起信号的最大数量。

13. RLIMIT_STACK

    最大栈空间，单位是字节。在扩展进程的用户态栈时，内核会检查这个值。

14. RLIMIT_NICE
    
    优先级的完美值。进程可通过setpriority()或nice()设置。

15. RLIMIT_RTPRIO

    最大实时优先级。进程可通过sched_setscheduler和sched_setparam设置。

16. RLIMIT_RTTIME

    实时任务的timeout，单位是uS。

结构体成员rlim_cur表示对当前进程的资源限制。比如`current->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_CPU].rlim_cur`是指当前正在运行的进程的CPU时间限制。

成员rlim_max表示资源限制允许的最大值。可以通过getrlimit()和setrlimit()系统调用进行设置，用户可以增加rlim_max的值到rlim_max。但是，超级用户（更准确地将，具有CAP_SYS_RESOURCE能力的用户）可以增加rlim_max的值，或者将rlim_cur设为超过rlim_max的值。

> 这就是为什么当我们的程序崩溃时，却发现没有core文件，这是因为系统默认是关闭的。所以需要调用命令
>       
>       ulimit -c unlimited // 设置core文件大小为不限制大小
>       
> 然后才能看到core文件的原因。

但是，我们查看源码的时候会发现，大部分的资源限制都被设为RLIM_INFINITY（0xffffffff），这意味对资源没有用户限制（当然了，本身还要受到硬件的限制：比如可用的RAM，硬盘实际空间等等）。这是因为我们想要保留软件设置的自由度，如果代码中直接写死对硬件资源的限制，软件操作的空间就会变小。

通过上面的方法，系统管理员可以更改对资源的限制。当用户登陆到系统时，内核创建一个超级用户拥有的进程，通过它调用setrlimit()减小rlim_max和rlim_cur的值；然后执行login shell，成为用户态进程（实际就是进程init）。用户新创建的进程继承它父进程的rlim数组内容，所以，用用也不能覆盖掉由超级用户赋值的限制值。

<h2 id="3.3">3.3 进程切换</h2>

进程切换，又称为任务切换、上下文切换、或者任务调度。下面我们就来研究Linux的进程切换。

<h3 id="3.3.1">3.3.1 硬件上下文</h3>

尽管每个进程都有自己的地址空间，但是所有的进程却共享CPU寄存器。所以，在恢复进程执行之前，内核必须保证该进程在挂起时的寄存器值重新加载到CPU的寄存器中。

这些需要加载到CPU寄存器中的值就成为硬件上下文。硬件上下文是进程执行上下文的一个子集，进程执行上下文包含进程执行所需要的所有信息。在Linux中，进程的硬件上下文一部分存储在进程描述符中，而其它部分存储在内核态的栈中。

在下面的描述中，我们假设，局部变量prev指向将要被替换掉的进程，而next指向将要替换的进程。因此，我们就可以说，进程切换就是保存prev进程的硬件上下文，然后加载next进程的硬件上下文。因为进程的切换非常频繁，所以最小化保存和加载硬件上下文内容的时间就显得非常重要了。

旧版本的linux利用x86架构提供的硬件支持，并通过远程调转指令（GNU-`ljump`；Intel-`jmp far`）进行进程切换，跳转到下一个进程的任务状态段（TSS）描述符。执行这条跳转指令的同时，CPU自动执行硬件上下文切换，保存旧的硬件上下文，加载新的硬件上下文。但是，linux2.6版本以后，通过软件进行进程切换，原因如下：

* 通过一连串的mov指令，一步步执行切换，可以更好地控制加载数据的合法性。由其是ds和es段寄存器中的值，有可能会被恶意用户篡改。如果使用远程跳转指令是无法进程数据检查的。

* 新旧方法所要求的时间是大致相同的。但是，优化硬件上下文的切换是不可能的，因为都是由CPU完成的，而Linux是使用软件代替硬件上下文切换的，所以有优化的空间，一遍提高执行时间。

进程切换只能发生在内核态。在进行进程切换之前，用户态进程使用的所有寄存器内容都已经包含在内核态的栈中了。这其中就包含指定用户态进程栈指针地址的ss和esp这对寄存器内容。

<h3 id="3.3.2">3.3.2 任务状态段-TSS</h3>

x86架构包含一个特殊的段寄存器，称为任务状态段（TSS），用来保存硬件上下文内容。尽管Linux不使用硬件上下文切换，但还是给每个不同CPU建立一个TSS。这么做，基于两个原因：

* 当x86架构的CPU从用户态到内核态时，会从TSS中获取内核态的栈地址（参见第4章的[中断和异常的硬件处理](#4.2.4)和第10章的[通过系统进入指令发送系统调用](#10.3.2)）

* 用户态进程想要访问I/O端口的时候，CPU需要访问存储在TSS中的I/O权限位，判断进程是否被允许访问这个I/O端口。那么，当用户态进程执行in或out指令时，I/O控制单元到底做了什么呢？

    1. 检查eflags寄存器中IOPL位（2位）。如果等于3，也就是超级用户权限，也就是进程对于这个I/O端口来说就是一个超级用户，那么，直接执行I/O指令。否则，继续执行检查。
    2. 访问tr寄存器，确定当前的TSS，以及正确的I/O访问权限。
    3. 它检查I/O端口对应的访问权限位。如果清零，指令被执行；否则，控制单元发出**常规保护**的异常。

内核中使用tss_struct结构体描述TSS。init_tss数组为系统中的每一个CPU包含一个tss_struct结构。每一次进程切换，内核更新TSS相关内容，使CPU控制单元能够安全地检索自己想要的信息。因而，TSS反映了当前运行在CPU上的进程的特权级别，但是当进程不运行的时候，无需维护这些信息。

每个TSS具有8个字节长度的任务状态段描述符（TSSD）。这个描述符包含一个32位的基地址，指向TSS的起始地址
以及20位的Limit域，表示页的大小。TSSD的S标志被清零，说明这是一个系统段（参见第2章的[段描述符](#2.2.2)）。

Type域设置为9或者11都可以，表明该段是一个TSS段即可。Intel最初的设计中，系统中的每个进程都应该引用自己的TSS：Type域的低第2个有效位称为Busy位，如果被设为1，进程正在CPU上执行；设为0，没有执行。在Linux的设计中，每个CPU就只有一个TSS，所以，Busy位总是设为1。换句话说，Linux中Type域一般为11。

创建的这些TSSD存储在全局描述符表（GDT）中，该表的基地址存储在CPU的gdtr寄存器中。每个CPU的tr寄存器包含对应TSS的TSSD选择器，还包含两个隐藏的、不可编程的域：TSSD的Base和Limit域。使用这种方法，CPU可以直接寻址TSS，而不必非得访问GDT中TSS的地址。

<h4 id="3.3.2.1">3.3.2.1 线程域</h4>

每当进程切换时，将要被替换掉的进程硬件上下文内容都应该被保存到某个地址。显然不能保存在TSS中，因为Linux为每个CPU就建立了一个TSS，而不是为每个进程建立TSS。

因而，进程描述符中添加了一个类型为thread_struct的结构，通过它，内核保存将要被切换出的进程的硬件上下文。后面我们会看到，该数据结构包含了大部分的CPU寄存器，除了通用目的寄存器，比如eax、ebx等，它们被存储在内核态的栈中。

<h3 id="3.3.3">3.3.3 执行进程切换</h3>

关于进程切换的时机：schedule()函数，我们在[第7章](#7)再讨论。这儿，我们只关注如何执行进程切换。

基本上，进程的切换分为两步：

1. 切换页全局目录（PGD），切换到新的地址空间；这一步的内容，我们将在[第9章](#9)讨论。
2. 切换内核态栈和硬件上下文内容，提供执行新进程所需要的所有信息，包括CPU寄存器。

我们仍然假设prev指向被切换掉的进程描述符，next指向将要执行的进程描述符。我们将会在第7章发现，prev和next正是schedule()函数的局部变量。

<h4 id="3.3.3.1">3.3.3.1 switch_to宏</h4>

The second step of the process switch is performed by the switch_to macro. It is one of the most hardware-dependent routines of the kernel, and it takes some effort to understand what it does.

First of all, the macro has three parameters, called prev, next, and last. You might easily guess the role of prev and next: they are just placeholders for the local variables prev and next, that is, they are input parameters that specify the memory locations containing the descriptor address of the process being replaced and the descriptor address of the new process, respectively.

What about the third parameter, last? Well, in any process switch three processes are involved, not just two. Suppose the kernel decides to switch off process A and to activate process B. In the schedule() function, prev points to A’s descriptor and next points to B’s descriptor. As soon as the switch_to macro deactivates A, the execution flow of A freezes.

Later, when the kernel wants to reactivate A, it must switch off another process C (in general, this is different from B) by executing another switch_to macro with prev pointing to C and next pointing to A. When A resumes its execution flow, it finds its old Kernel Mode stack, so the prev local variable points to A’s descriptor and next points to B’s descriptor. The scheduler, which is now executing on behalf of process A, has lost any reference to C. This reference, however, turns out to be useful to complete the process switching (see Chapter 7 for more details).

The last parameter of the switch_to macro is an output parameter that specifies a memory location in which the macro writes the descriptor address of process C (of course, this is done after A resumes its execution). Before the process switching, the macro saves in the eax CPU register the content of the variable identified by the first input parameter prev—that is, the prev local variable allocated on the Kernel Mode stack of A. After the process switching, when A has resumed its execution, the macro writes the content of the eax CPU register in the memory location of A identified by the third output parameter last. Because the CPU register doesn’t change across the process switch, this memory location receives the address of C’s descriptor. In the current implementation of schedule(), the last parameter identifies the prev local variable of A, so prev is overwritten with the address of C.

The contents of the Kernel Mode stacks of processes A, B, and C are shown in Figure 3-7, together with the values of the eax register; be warned that the figure shows the value of the prev local variable before its value is overwritten with the contents of the eax register.

<img id="Figure_3_7" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_3_7.PNG">

The switch_to macro is coded in extended inline assembly language that makes for rather complex reading: in fact, the code refers to registers by means of a special positional notation that allows the compiler to freely choose the general-purpose registers to be used. Rather than follow the cumbersome extended inline assembly language, we’ll describe what the switch_to macro typically does on an 80×86 microprocessor by using standard assembly language:

1. 将新旧进程描述符存放到CPU寄存器中：

        movl prev, %eax
        movl next, %edx

2. Saves the contents of the eflags and ebp registers in the prev Kernel Mode stack. They must be saved because the compiler assumes that they will stay unchanged until the end of switch_to:
2. 保存旧进程的内核态栈中的`eflags`和`ebp`寄存器的内容。它们必须被保存，因为

        pushfl
        pushl %ebp

3. 保存旧进程的栈到`prev->thread.esp`中

        movl %esp,484(%eax)

    操作数`484(%eax)`表明目的地址是寄存器`eax`中的地址加上`484`。

4. 将新进程的栈指针加载到`esp`寄存器中。next->thread.esp in esp. From now on, the kernel operates on the Kernel Mode stack of next, so this instruction performs the actual process switch from prev to next. Because the address of a process descriptor is closely related to that of the Kernel Mode stack (as explained in the section “Identifying a Process” earlier in this chapter), changing the kernel stack means changing the current process:

        movl 484(%edx), %esp

5. Saves the address labeled 1 (shown later in this section) in prev->thread.eip.
When the process being replaced resumes its execution, the process executes the
instruction labeled as 1:

        movl $1f, 480(%eax)

6. On the Kernel Mode stack of next, the macro pushes the next->thread.eip
value, which, in most cases, is the address labeled as 1:

        pushl 480(%edx)

7. Jumps to the __switch_to() C function (see next):

        jmp __switch_to

8. Here process A that was replaced by B gets the CPU again: it executes a few
instructions that restore the contents of the eflags and ebp registers. The first of
these two instructions is labeled as 1:

        1:
            popl %ebp
            popfl

    Notice how these pop instructions refer to the kernel stack of the prev process. They will be executed when the scheduler selects prev as the new process to be executed on the CPU, thus invoking switch_to with prev as the second parameter. Therefore, the esp register points to the prev’s Kernel Mode stack.

9. Copies the content of the eax register (loaded in step 1 above) into the memory location identified by the third parameter last of the switch_to macro:

        movl %eax, last

    As discussed earlier, the eax register points to the descriptor of the process that has just been replaced.

<h4 id="3.3.3.2">3.3.3.2 __switch_to()函数</h4>

The __switch_to() function does the bulk of the process switch started by the
switch_to() macro. It acts on the prev_p and next_p parameters that denote the
former process and the new process. This function call is different from the average
function call, though, because __switch_to() takes the prev_p and next_p parameters
from the eax and edx registers (where we saw they were stored), not from the
stack like most functions. To force the function to go to the registers for its parameters,
the kernel uses the __attribute__ and regparm keywords, which are nonstandard
extensions of the C language implemented by the gcc compiler. The __switch_
to() function is declared in the include/asm-i386/system.h header file as follows:

    __switch_to(struct task_struct *prev_p,
            struct task_struct *next_p)
        __attribute__(regparm(3));

The steps performed by the function are the following:

1. Executes the code yielded by the __unlazy_fpu() macro (see the section “Saving
and Loading the FPU, MMX, and XMM Registers” later in this chapter) to
optionally save the contents of the FPU, MMX, and XMM registers of the prev_p
process.

    __unlazy_fpu(prev_p);

2. Executes the smp_processor_id() macro to get the index of the local CPU,
namely the CPU that executes the code. The macro gets the index from the cpu
field of the thread_info structure of the current process and stores it into the cpu
local variable.

3. Loads next_p->thread.esp0 in the esp0 field of the TSS relative to the local CPU;
as we’ll see in the section “Issuing a System Call via the sysenter Instruction” in
Chapter 10, any future privilege level change from User Mode to Kernel Mode
raised by a sysenter assembly instruction will copy this address in the esp register:

        init_tss[cpu].esp0 = next_p->thread.esp0;

4. Loads in the Global Descriptor Table of the local CPU the Thread-Local Storage (TLS) segments used by the next_p process; the three Segment Selectors are stored in the tls_array array inside the process descriptor (see the section “Segmentation in Linux” in Chapter 2).

        cpu_gdt_table[cpu][6] = next_p->thread.tls_array[0];
        cpu_gdt_table[cpu][7] = next_p->thread.tls_array[1];
        cpu_gdt_table[cpu][8] = next_p->thread.tls_array[2];

5. Stores the contents of the fs and gs segmentation registers in prev_p->thread.fs
and prev_p->thread.gs, respectively; the corresponding assembly language
instructions are:

        movl %fs, 40(%esi)
        movl %gs, 44(%esi)

    The esi register points to the prev_p->thread structure.

6. If the fs or the gs segmentation register have been used either by the prev_p or
by the next_p process (i.e., if they have a nonzero value), loads into these registers
the values stored in the thread_struct descriptor of the next_p process. This
step logically complements the actions performed in the previous step. The main
assembly language instructions are:

        movl 40(%ebx),%fs
        movl 44(%ebx),%gs

        The ebx register points to the next_p->thread structure. The code is actually
more intricate, as an exception might be raised by the CPU when it detects an
invalid segment register value. The code takes this possibility into account by
adopting a “fix-up” approach (see the section “Dynamic Address Checking: The
Fix-up Code” in Chapter 10).

7. Loads six of the dr0, ..., dr7 debug registers* with the contents of the next_p->
thread.debugreg array. This is done only if next_p was using the debug registers
when it was suspended (that is, field next_p->thread.debugreg[7] is not 0).
These registers need not be saved, because the prev_p->thread.debugreg array is
modified only when a debugger wants to monitor prev:

        if (next_p->thread.debugreg[7]){
            loaddebug(&next_p->thread, 0);
            loaddebug(&next_p->thread, 1);
            loaddebug(&next_p->thread, 2);
            loaddebug(&next_p->thread, 3);
            /* no 4 and 5 */
            loaddebug(&next_p->thread, 6);
            loaddebug(&next_p->thread, 7);
        }

8. Updates the I/O bitmap in the TSS, if necessary. This must be done when either
next_p or prev_p has its own customized I/O Permission Bitmap:

        if (prev_p->thread.io_bitmap_ptr || next_p->thread.io_bitmap_ptr)
            handle_io_bitmap(&next_p->thread, &init_tss[cpu]);

    Because processes seldom modify the I/O Permission Bitmap, this bitmap is handled
in a “lazy” mode: the actual bitmap is copied into the TSS of the local CPU
only if a process actually accesses an I/O port in the current timeslice. The customized
I/O Permission Bitmap of a process is stored in a buffer pointed to by
the io_bitmap_ptr field of the thread_info structure. The handle_io_bitmap()
function sets up the io_bitmap field of the TSS used by the local CPU for the
next_p process as follows:

    * If the next_p process does not have its own customized I/O Permission Bitmap, the io_bitmap field of the TSS is set to the value 0x8000.
    * If the next_p process has its own customized I/O Permission Bitmap, the io_bitmap field of the TSS is set to the value 0x9000.

    The io_bitmap field of the TSS should contain an offset inside the TSS where the
actual bitmap is stored. The 0x8000 and 0x9000 values point outside of the TSS
limit and will thus cause a “General protection” exception whenever the User
Mode process attempts to access an I/O port (see the section “Exceptions” in
Chapter 4). The do_general_protection() exception handler will check the value
stored in the io_bitmap field: if it is 0x8000, the function sends a SIGSEGV signal to
the User Mode process; otherwise, if it is 0x9000, the function copies the process
bitmap (pointed to by the io_bitmap_ptr field in the thread_info structure) in the
TSS of the local CPU, sets the io_bitmap field to the actual bitmap offset (104),
and forces a new execution of the faulty assembly language instruction.

9. Terminates. The __switch_to() C function ends by means of the statement:

        return prev_p;

    The corresponding assembly language instructions generated by the compiler are:

        movl %edi,%eax
        ret

    The prev_p parameter (now in edi) is copied into eax, because by default the
return value of any C function is passed in the eax register. Notice that the value
of eax is thus preserved across the invocation of __switch_to(); this is quite
important, because the invoking switch_to macro assumes that eax always stores
the address of the process descriptor being replaced.

    The ret assembly language instruction loads the eip program counter with the
return address stored on top of the stack. However, the __switch_to() function
has been invoked simply by jumping into it. Therefore, the ret instruction finds
on the stack the address of the instruction labeled as 1, which was pushed by
the switch_to macro. If next_p was never suspended before because it is being
executed for the first time, the function finds the starting address of the ret_
from_fork() function (see the section “The clone(), fork(), and vfork() System
Calls” later in this chapter).

<h1 id="5">5 内核同步</h1>

You could think of the kernel as a server that answers requests; these requests can come either from a process running on a CPU or an external device issuing an interrupt request. We make this analogy to underscore that parts of the kernel are not run serially, but in an interleaved way. Thus, they can give rise to race conditions, which must be controlled through proper synchronization techniques. A general introduction to these topics can be found in the section “An Overview of Unix Kernels” in Chapter 1.

We start this chapter by reviewing when, and to what extent, kernel requests are executed in an interleaved fashion. We then introduce the basic synchronization primitives implemented by the kernel and describe how they are applied in the most common cases. Finally, we illustrate a few practical examples.

<h2 id="5">5.1 内核服务如何请求</h2>

To get a better grasp of how kernel’s code is executed, we will look at the kernel as a waiter who must satisfy two types of requests: those issued by customers and those issued by a limited number of different bosses. The policy adopted by the waiter is the following:

1. If a boss calls while the waiter is idle, the waiter starts servicing the boss.
2. If a boss calls while the waiter is servicing a customer, the waiter stops servicing the customer and starts servicing the boss.

Each Unix process owns a specific memory region called the heap, which is used to satisfy the process’s dynamic memory requests. The start_brk and brk fields of the memory descriptor delimit the starting and ending addresses, respectively, of that region.

The following APIs can be used by the process to request and release dynamic memory:

<h1 id="10">10 系统调用</h1>

Operating systems offer processes running in user mode a set of interfaces to interact with hardware devices such as the CPU, disks, and printers. Putting extralayer between the application and the hardware has several advantages. First, it makes programming easier by freeing users from studying low-level programming characteristics of hardware devices. Second, it greatly increases system security, because the kernel can check the accuracy of the request at the interface level before attempting to satisfy it. Last but not least, these interfaces make programs more portable, because the can be compiled and executed correctly on every kernel that offers the same set of interfaces.

Unix systems implement most interfaces between User Mode processes and hardware devices by means of system calls issued to the kernel. This chapter examines in detail how Linux implements system calls that User Mode programs issue to the kernel.

<h2 id="10.1">10.1 POSIX API和系统调用</h2>

Let's start by stressing the difference between an application programmer interface(API) and a system call. The former is a function definition that specifies how to obtain a given service, while the latter is an explicit request to the kernel made via a software interrupt.

Unix systems include several libraries of functions that provide APIs to programmers. Some of the APIs defined by the *libc* standard C library refer to *wrapper routines*(routines whose only purpose is to issue a system call). Usually, each system call has a corresponding wrapper routine, which defines the API that application programs should employ.

The converse is not true, by the way - an API does not necessarily correspond to a specific system call. First of all, the API offer its services directly in User Mode.(For something abstact such as math functions, there may be no reason to make system calls.) Second, a single API function could make several system calls. Moreover, several API functions could make the same system call, but wrap extra functionality aound it. For instance, in Linux, the *malloc()*, *calloc()*, and *free()* APIs are implemented in the *libc* library. The code in this library keeps track of the allocation and deallocation requests and uses the *brk*() system call to enlarge or shrink the process heap (see the section "Managing the Heap" in [Chapter 9](#9))

The POSIX standard refers to APIs and not to system calls. A system can be certified as POSIX-compliant if it offers the proper set of APIs to the application programs, no matter how the corresponding functions are implemented. As a matter of fact, several non-Unix systems have been certified as POSIX-compliant, because they offer all traditional Unix services in User Mode libraries.

From the programmer’s point of view, the distinction between an API and a system call is irrelevant — the only things that matter are the function name, the parameter types, and the meaning of the return code. From the kernel designer’s point of view, however, the distinction does matter because system calls belong to the kernel, while User Mode libraries don’t.

Most wrapper routines return an integer value, whose meaning depends on the corresponding system call. A return value of –1 usually indicates that the kernel was unable to satisfy the process request. A failure in the system call handler may be caused by invalid parameters, a lack of available resources, hardware problems, and so on. The specific error code is contained in the *errno* variable, which is defined in the libc library.

Each error code is defined as a macro constant, which yields a corresponding positive integer value. The POSIX standard specifies the macro names of several error codes. In Linux, on 80×86 systems, these macros are defined in the header file *include/asm-i386/errno.h*. To allow portability of C programs among Unix systems, the *include/asm-i386/errno.h* header file is included, in turn, in the standard */usr/include/errno.h* C library header file. Other systems have their own specialized subdirectories of header files.

核心笔记：

1. POSIX API和系统调用的区别：

    `POSIX API`可以理解为一些标准C函数库，而系统调用是在其上进行的封装，以满足用户态和内核态切换需要。系统只要是使用符合`POSIX`标准定义的函数实现系统调用，就是与`POSIX`兼容的。

2. 为什么这么设计？不直接使用API？

    如果使用API，那么用户态程序可以直接访问硬件资源，这与`进程/内核`模型的设计理念不符。使用系统调用有2个好处：

    * 用户态和内核态隔离开来，访问更加安全
    * 便于用户态程序的移植

3. 对于系统调用，用户可能更关心返回值。

    其返回值用一个整数表示，其宏定义位于 *include/arch-specific/errno.h*头文件中。在这儿，`arch-specific`与系统平台的架构相关。用户态的 标准C库的 */usr/include/errno.h*头文件中也应该包含这些错误返回码。

<h2 id="10.2">10.2 系统调用处理程序和服务例程</h2>

When a User Mode process invokes a system call, the CPU switches to Kernel Mode
and starts the execution of a kernel function. As we will see in the next section, in the
80×86 architecture a Linux system call can be invoked in two different ways. The net
result of both methods, however, is a jump to an assembly language function called
the *system call handler*.

Because the kernel implements many different system calls, the User Mode process
must pass a parameter called the *system call number* to identify the required system
call; the *eax* register is used by Linux for this purpose. As we’ll see in the section
“Parameter Passing” later in this chapter, additional parameters are usually passed
when invoking a system call.

All system calls return an integer value. The conventions for these return values are
different from those for wrapper routines. In the kernel, positive or 0 values denote a
successful termination of the system call, while negative values denote an error condition.
In the latter case, the value is the negation of the error code that must be
returned to the application program in the *errno* variable. The *errno* variable is not
set or used by the kernel. Instead, the wrapper routines handle the task of setting this
variable after a return from a system call.

The system call handler, which has a structure similar to that of the other exception
handlers, performs the following operations:

* Saves the contents of most registers in the Kernel Mode stack (this operation is common to all system calls and is coded in assembly language).

* Handles the system call by invoking a corresponding C function called the *system call service routine*.

* Exits from the handler: the registers are loaded with the values saved in the Kernel Mode stack, and the CPU is switched back from Kernel Mode to User Mode (this operation is common to all system calls and is coded in assembly language).

The name of the service routine associated with the *xyz()* system call is usually *sys_xyz()*; there are, however, a few exceptions to this rule.

Figure 10-1 illustrates the relationships between the application program that invokes a system call, the corresponding wrapper routine, the system call handler, and the system call service routine. The arrows denote the execution flow between the functions. The terms “SYSCALL” and “SYSEXIT” are placeholders for the actual assembly language instructions that switch the CPU, respectively, from User Mode to Kernel Mode and from Kernel Mode to User Mode.

<img id="Figure_10-1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupelo-shen/my_test/master/doc/linux/qemu/Linux_kernel_analysis/images/understanding_linux_kernel_10_1.PNG">

图10-1 系统调用的过程

To associate each system call number with its corresponding service routine, the kernel uses a *system call dispatch table*, which is stored in the *sys_call_table* array and has *NR_syscalls* entries (289 in the Linux 2.6.11 kernel). The Nth entry contains the service routine address of the system call having number N.

The *NR_syscalls* macro is just a static limit on the maximum number of implementable system calls; it does not indicate the number of system calls actually implemented. Indeed, each entry of the dispatch table may contain the address of the *sys_ni_syscall()* function, which is the service routine of the “nonimplemented” system calls; it just returns the error code -ENOSYS.



<h2 id="10.3">10.3 进入和退出系统调用</h2>

Native applications* can invoke a system call in two different ways:

* By executing the int $0x80 assembly language instruction; in older versions of the Linux kernel, this was the only way to switch from User Mode to Kernel Mode.

* By executing the sysenter assembly language instruction, introduced in the Intel Pentium II microprocessors; this instruction is now supported by the Linux 2.6 kernel.

Similarly, the kernel can exit from a system call—thus switching the CPU back to User Mode—in two ways:

* By executing the *iret* assembly language instruction.

* By executing the sysexit assembly language instruction, which was introduced in the Intel Pentium II microprocessors together with the sysenter instruction.

However, supporting two different ways to enter the kernel is not as simple as it might look, because:

* The kernel must support both older libraries that only use the int $0x80 instruction and more recent ones that also use the sysenter instruction.

* A standard library that makes use of the sysenter instruction must be able to cope with older kernels that support only the int $0x80 instruction.

* The kernel and the standard library must be able to run both on older processors that do not include the sysenter instruction and on more recent ones that include it.

We will see in the section “Issuing a System Call via the sysenter Instruction” later in this chapter how the Linux kernel solves these compatibility problems.

<h3 id="10.3.1">10.3.1 使用中断$0x80指令发起系统调用</h3>

The “traditional” way to invoke a system call makes use of the *int* assembly language instruction, which was discussed in the section “Hardware Handling of Interrupts and Exceptions” in [Chapter 4](#4).

The vector 128—in hexadecimal, 0x80—is associated with the kernel entry point. The *trap_init()* function, invoked during kernel initialization, sets up the Interrupt Descriptor Table entry corresponding to vector 128 as follows:

    set_system_gate(0x80, &system_call);

The call loads the following values into the gate descriptor fields (see the section “Interrupt, Trap, and System Gates” in [Chapter 4](#4)):

* Segment Selector
* Offset
* Type
* DPL(Descriptor Privilege Level)

    Set to 3. This allows processes in User Mode to invoke the exception handler (see the section “Hardware Handling of Interrupts and Exceptions” in Chapter 4).

Therefore, when a User Mode process issues an *int $0x80* instruction, the CPU switches into Kernel Mode and starts executing instructions from the *system_call* address.

<h4 id="10.3.1.1">10.3.1.1 system_call()函数</h4>

The *system_call()* function starts by saving the system call number and all the CPU registers that may be used by the exception handler on the stack—except for eflags,
cs, eip, ss, and esp, which have already been saved automatically by the control unit
(see the section “Hardware Handling of Interrupts and Exceptions” in Chapter 4).
The SAVE_ALL macro, which was already discussed in the section “I/O Interrupt Handling”
in Chapter 4, also loads the Segment Selector of the kernel data segment in ds
and es:

<h1 id="21">21 系统启动</h1>

This appendix explains what happens right after users switch on their computers—that is, how a Linux kernel image is copied into memory and executed. In short, we discuss how the kernel, and thus the whole system, is “bootstrapped.”

本章主要讲解计算机打开后到底会发生什么-也就是说，内核镜像如何被拷贝到内存上并执行的。

Traditionally, the term bootstrap refers to a person who tries to stand up by pulling his own boots. In operating systems, the term denotes bringing at least a portion of the operating system into main memory and having the processor execute it. It also denotes the initialization of kernel data structures, the creation of some user processes, and the transfer of control to one of them.

所谓`引导`，就是如何把操作系统加载到主内存并让处理器执行它。还要完成内核数据结构的初始化，创建一些进程并将控制权交给其中一个的过程。

Computer bootstrapping is a tedious, long task, because initially, nearly every hardware device, including the RAM, is in a random, unpredictable state. Moreover, the bootstrap process is highly dependent on the computer architecture; as usual in this book, we refer to the 80×86 architecture.

计算机引导是一个冗长、复杂的任务，因为几乎所有的硬件，包括RAM，处于一个混乱无序的状态。更重要的是，引导过程严重依赖计算机硬件架构。本书专注于x86架构。

<h2 id="21.1">21.1 BIOS</h2>

The moment after a computer is powered on, it is practically useless because the RAM chips contain random data and no operating system is running. To begin the boot, a special hardware circuit raises the logical value of the RESET pin of the CPU. After RESET is asserted, some registers of the processor (including cs and eip) are set to fixed values, and the code found at physical address `0xfffffff0` is executed. This address is mapped by the hardware to a certain read-only, persistent memory chip that is often called Read-Only Memory (ROM). The set of programs stored in ROM is traditionally called the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) in the 80×86 architecture, because it includes several interrupt-driven low-level procedures used by all operating systems in the booting phase to handle the hardware devices that make up the computer. Some operating systems, such as Microsoft’s MS-DOS, rely on BIOS to implement most system calls.

Once in protected mode (see the section [“Segmentation in Hardware” in Chapter 2](#2.2)), Linux does not use BIOS any longer, but it provides its own device driver for every hardware device on the computer. In fact, the BIOS procedures must be executed in real mode, so they cannot share functions even if that would be beneficial.

The BIOS uses Real Mode addresses because they are the only ones available when the computer is turned on. A Real Mode address is composed of a *seg* segment and an *off* offset; the corresponding physical address is given by *seg*\*16+*off*. As a result, no Global Descriptor Table, Local Descriptor Table, or paging table is needed by the CPU addressing circuit to translate a logical address into a physical one. Clearly, the code that initializes the GDT, LDT, and paging tables must run in Real Mode.

BIOS使用实模式地址。实模式地址由 *seg*的段地址和 *off*的偏移量组成，所以实际的物理地址就是 *seg*\*16+*off*。没有GDT（全局描述符表）、LDT（局部描述符表）或页表。很明显，运行在实模式的代码需要初始化GDT、LDT和页表。

Linux is forced to use BIOS in the bootstrapping phase, when it must retrieve the kernel image from disk or from some other external device. The BIOS bootstrap procedure essentially performs the following four operations:

如果Linux内核镜像存储在硬盘或者其它外部设备，则必须在引导阶段使用BIOS检索内核。BIOS引导程序主要执行下面4步：

1. Executes a series of tests on the computer hardware to establish which devices are present and whether they are working properly. This phase is often called <font color="blue">Power-On Self-Test (POST)</font>. During this phase, several messages, such as the BIOS version banner, are displayed.

    Recent 80×86, AMD64, and Itanium computers make use of the *Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)* standard. The bootstrap code in an ACPI-compliant BIOS builds several tables that describe the hardware devices present in the system. These tables have a vendor-independent format and can be read by the operating system kernel to learn how to handle the devices.

    第一步，完成硬件上电自检测，专业术语称为 *Power-On Self-Test (POST)*。

2. <font color="blue">Initializes the hardware devices</font>. This phase is crucial in modern PCI-based architectures, because it guarantees that all hardware devices operate without conflicts on the IRQ lines and I/O ports. At the end of this phase, a table of installed PCI devices is displayed.

    第二步，初始化硬件。这一步对于现代基于PCI的硬件架构非常重要，可以检查IRQ中断线和I/O端口是否有冲突。完成这一步，会建立一个已安装的PCI设备的表。

3. Searches for an operating system to boot. Actually, depending on the BIOS setting, the procedure may try to access (in a predefined, customizable order) the first sector (boot sector) of every floppy disk, hard disk, and CD-ROM in the system.

    搜索需要引导的操作系统。检索的对象依赖于BIOS的设置，比如软盘、硬盘和CD-ROM中的第一个扇区，也称为引导扇区。

4. As soon as a valid device is found, it copies the contents of its first sector into RAM, starting from physical address 0x00007c00, and then jumps into that address and executes the code just loaded.

    只要找到合法的设备，就会把第一个扇区的内容拷贝到RAM，从物理地址0x00007c00开始，然后跳转到此地址并开始执行刚刚加载的代码。

The rest of this appendix takes you from the most primitive starting state to the full glory of a running Linux system.

本章余下的部分，将会从最原始的启动阶段到Linux系统运行起来，进行一一阐述。

<h2 id="21.2">21.2 Bootloader</h2>

The boot loader is the program invoked by the BIOS to load the image of an operating system kernel into RAM. Let’s briefly sketch how boot loaders work in IBM’s PC architecture.

`boot loader`是BIOS为了加载操作系统内核到RAM而调用的程序。让我们简要概括一下在IBM的PC里boot loader是如何工作的。

To boot from a floppy disk, the instructions stored in its first sector are loaded in RAM and executed; these instructions copy all the remaining sectors containing the kernel image into RAM.

为了从软盘引导，存储在它的第一个扇区的代码被加载到RAM并执行；这些代码会被内核镜像加载到RAM中。

Booting from a hard disk is done differently. The first sector of the hard disk, named the Master Boot Record (MBR), includes the partition table* and a small program, which loads the first sector of the partition containing the operating system to be started. Some operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows 98, identify this partition by means of an active flag included in the partition table;† following this approach, only the operating system whose kernel image is stored in the active partition can be booted. As we will see later, Linux is more flexible because it replaces the rudimentary<font color="blue">基本的，初级的</font> program included in the MBR with a  sophisticated program—the “boot loader”—that allows users to select the operating system to be booted.

硬盘引导与软盘引导不太一样。硬盘的第一个扇区，称为`MBR`，包含分区表和一小段程序，它会加载分区中的第一个扇区里的操作系统。一些操作系统，比如Windows 98，会通过分区表中一个激活标志位判断该分区是哪个。使用这种方法，这有把操作系统的内核存储到该激活分区中才能被引导。后面我们还会介绍，Linux实际更为灵活，因为它替换了MBR中的这个简单程序，而使用一个更为复杂的程序，称为`boot loader`，允许用户可以选择将要引导的操作系统。

Kernel images of earlier Linux versions—up to the 2.4 series—included a minimal “boot loader” program in the first 512 bytes; thus, copying a kernel image starting from the first sector made the floppy bootable. On the other hand, kernel images of Linux 2.6 no longer include such boot loader; thus, in order to boot from floppy disk, a suitable boot loader has to be stored in the first disk sector. Nowadays, booting from a floppy is very similar to booting from a hard disk or from a CD-ROM.

早期Linux版本（直到2.4系列）的内核镜像在开始的512字节，包含一个最小的`boot loader`程序；因而，从第一个扇区开始复制内核镜像是可以从软盘启动的。但是，从Linux2.6版本开始，不再包含这样的引导程序；因而为了从软盘引导，必须选择一个合适的引导程序存储在软盘的第一个扇区。如今，从软盘引导和从硬盘或CD-ROM引导非常类似了。

<h2 id="21.2.1">21.2.1 从硬盘引导Linux</h2>

A two-stage boot loader is required to boot a Linux kernel from disk. A well-known Linux boot loader on 80×86 systems is named LInux LOader (LILO). Other boot loaders for 80×86 systems do exist; for instance, the GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) is also widely used. GRUB is more advanced than LILO, because it recognizes several disk-based filesystems and is thus capable of reading portions of the boot program from files. Of course, specific boot loader programs exist for all architectures supported by Linux.

从硬盘引导Linux内核，引导程序需要完成两个阶段的工作。x86系统上，一个著名的Linux引导程序叫做`LILO`。还有一些其它的引导程序，比如`GRUB`。它比`LILO`更高级，可以识别几个基于硬盘的文件系统，因此有能力从文件中读取boot程序。当然了，Linux支持的所有架构都有自己特定的引导程序。

LILO may be installed either on the MBR (replacing the small program that loads the boot sector of the active partition) or in the boot sector of every disk partition. In both cases, the final result is the same: when the loader is executed at boot time, the user may choose which operating system to load.

LILO即可以安装在主引导记录`MBR`上（替换加载到激活分区的引导扇区的小引导程序），也可以安装在硬盘分区的引导扇区上。两种情况下，最终结果是一样的：当引导程序执行起来后，用户可以选择需要加载的操作系统。

Actually, the LILO boot loader is too large to fit into a single sector, thus it is broken into two parts. The MBR or the partition boot sector includes a small boot loader, which is loaded into RAM starting from address 0x00007c00 by the BIOS. This small program moves itself to the address 0x00096a00, sets up the Real Mode stack (ranging from 0x00098000 to 0x000969ff), loads the second part of the LILO boot loader into RAM starting from address 0x00096c00, and jumps into it.

实际上，LILO引导程序太大，无法在一个扇区上安装，因而它被分为2部分。MBR或者分区上的引导扇区包含一个小引导程序，它被BIOS加载到RAM，起始地址是0x00007c00。这个小引导程序将自身搬运到地址0x00096a00处，建立实模式堆栈（范围0x00098000~0x000969ff），然后加载LILO引导程序的第2部分到RAM中，起始地址是0x00096c00，然后跳转到该地址并执行。

In turn, this latter program reads a map of bootable operating systems from disk and offers the user a prompt so she can choose one of them. Finally, after the user has chosen the kernel to be loaded (or let a time-out elapse so that LILO chooses a default), the boot loader may either copy the boot sector of the corresponding partition into RAM and execute it or directly copy the kernel image into RAM.

接下来，引导程序的第二部分读取可引导操作系统的映射表，提供给用户可选择的提示。最后，用户选择了要加载的内核之后（如果超时，LILO选择默认），引导程序即可以拷贝相应分区的引导扇区内容到RAM中并执行，也可以直接拷贝内核到RAM中。

Assuming that a Linux kernel image must be booted, the LILO boot loader, which relies on BIOS routines, performs essentially the following operations:

要加载Linux内核镜像，LILO基本上要执行下面几步：

1. Invokes a BIOS procedure to display a “Loading” message.

    调用BIOS程序显示正在加载的消息。

2. Invokes a BIOS procedure to load an initial portion of the kernel image from disk: the first 512 bytes of the kernel image are put in RAM at address 0x00090000, while the code of the setup() function (see below) is put in RAM starting from address 0x00090200.

    调用BIOS程序从硬盘加载内核镜像的开始部分：把内核的头512字节存放到RAM地址0x00090000处，同时，把`setup()`函数加载到RAM地址0x00090200处。

3. Invokes a BIOS procedure to load the rest of the kernel image from disk and puts the image in RAM starting from either low address 0x00010000 (for small kernel images compiled with `make zImage`) or high address 0x00100000 (for big kernel images compiled with make bzImage). In the following discussion, we say that the kernel image is “loaded low” or “loaded high” in RAM, respectively. Support for big kernel images uses essentially the same booting scheme as the other one, but it places data in different physical memory addresses to avoid problems with the ISA hole mentioned in the section “Physical Memory Layout” in Chapter 2.

    调用BIOS程序从硬盘加载内核其余部分：如果内核镜像较小（使用`make zImage`编译），存放到低地址0x00010000处；如果内核镜像较大（使用`make bzImage`编译），则存放到高地址0x00100000处。大内核镜像的引导原理和其它引导基本上是一样的，只是为了避免和ISA空洞（可以查看[物理内存布局](#2.5.3)）产生冲突，把数据放在了不同的物理地址空间上。

4. Jumps to the setup() code.

    跳转到`setup()`函数。

<h2 id="21.3">21.3 setup()函数</h2>

The code of the `setup()` assembly language function has been placed by the linker at offset 0x200 of the kernel image file. The boot loader can therefore easily locate the code and copy it into RAM, starting from physical address 0x00090200.

汇编函数 `setup()`的代码由链接器将其链接到到内核镜像文件偏移量0x200处。因此，引导程序能够轻松地索引代码并将其拷贝到物理地址0x00090200处。

The `setup()` function must initialize the hardware devices in the computer and set up the environment for the execution of the kernel program. Although the BIOS already initialized most hardware devices, Linux does not rely on it, but reinitializes the devices in its own manner to enhance portability and robustness. `setup()` performs essentially the following operations:

`setup()`函数负责初始化硬件设备，为内核执行提供环境。尽管BIOS已经初始化了大部分硬件，但是为了系统的可移植性和健壮性，Linux按照自己的方式重新初始化硬件设备。`setup()`执行以下步骤：

1. In ACPI-compliant systems, it invokes a BIOS routine that builds a table in RAM describing the layout of the system’s physical memory (the table can be seen in the boot kernel messages by looking for the “BIOS-e820” label). In older systems, it invokes a BIOS routine that just returns the amount of RAM available in the system.

    遵循ACPI的系统，调用BIOS服务程序在RAM中构建一张关于系统物理地址布局的表（该表可以通过在内核引导信息中搜索`BIOS-e820`字样找到。在较旧的系统上，只是调用BIOS服务程序返回系统中可用的RAM数量。

2. Sets the keyboard repeat delay and rate. (When the user keeps a key pressed past a certain amount of time, the keyboard device sends the corresponding keycode over and over to the CPU.)

    设置键盘重复计数延时和速率。（当用户按下按键后一段时间，键盘设备就会向CPU连续不断地发送相应的键码。

3. Initializes the video adapter card.

    初始化视频适配器卡。

4. Reinitializes the disk controller and determines the hard disk parameters.

    重新初始化硬盘控制器并设置硬盘参数。

5. Checks for an IBM Micro Channel bus (MCA).

    检查IBM微通道总线（MCA）。

6. Checks for a PS/2 pointing device (bus mouse).

    检查PS/2所指向的设备。

7. Checks for Advanced Power Management (APM) BIOS support.

    检查高级电源管理（APM）BIOS支持。

8. If the BIOS supports the *Enhanced Disk Drive Services (EDD)*, it invokes the proper BIOS procedure to build a table in RAM describing the hard disks available in the system. (The information included in the table can be seen by reading the files in the *firmware/edd* directory of the *sysfs* special filesystem.)

    如果BIOS支持 *Enhanced Disk Drive Services (EDD)*，它会调用正确的BIOS程序构建一张表，用来描述系统中可用的硬盘。（表中的信息可以通过读取 *firmware/edd*和 *sysfs*文件目录下的文件查看。）

9. If the kernel image was loaded low in RAM (at physical address 0x00010000), the function moves it to physical address 0x00001000. Conversely, if the kernel image was loaded high in RAM, the function does not move it. This step is necessary because to be able to store the kernel image on a floppy disk and to reduce the booting time, the kernel image stored on disk is compressed, and the decompression routine needs some free space to use as a temporary buffer following the kernel image in RAM.

    如果内核镜像载入低内存区（物理地址0x00010000），该函数会将其移动到物理地址0x00001000处。相反，如果内核镜像载入高内存区（物理地址0x00100000），该函数不会搬运它。这一步是必要的，因为为了能够在软盘上存储内核镜像，同时也是为了减少引导时间，存储在软盘上的内核镜像被压缩，解压缩服务程序需要一些紧跟在内核镜像后面的空间作为临时缓存。

10. Sets the A20 pin located on the 8042 keyboard controller. The A20 pin is a hack introduced in the 80286-based systems to make physical addresses compatible with those of the ancient 8088 microprocessors. Unfortunately, the A20 pin must be properly set before switching to Protected Mode, otherwise the 21st bit of every physical address will always be regarded as zero by the CPU. Setting the A20 pin is a messy operation.

    设置A20管脚，用于8042键盘控制器。该管脚的存在是为了和基于80286的系统进行兼容。

11. Sets up a provisional Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) and a provisional Global Descriptor Table (GDT).

    建立临时中段描述表（IDT）和临时GDT（全局描述表）。

12. Resets the floating-point unit (FPU), if any.

    复位浮点单元（FPU），当然前提是支持的话。

13. Reprograms the Programmable Interrupt Controllers (PIC) to mask all interrupts, except IRQ2 which is the cascading interrupt between the two PICs.

    重新设置可编程中断控制器（PIC）屏蔽所有中断，除了IRQ2，它是专门用于2个PIC级联的。

14. Switches the CPU from Real Mode to Protected Mode by setting the PE bit in the cr0 status register. The PG bit in the cr0 register is cleared, so paging is still disabled.

    设置cr0寄存器的PE标志位，切换CPU从实模式到保护模式。同时，cr0寄存器中的PG位被清除，所以此时分页机制仍然是禁止的。

15. Jumps to the startup_32() assembly language function.

    跳转到汇编函数`startup_32()`处。

<h2 id="21.4">21.4 setup_32()函数</h2>

There are two different startup_32() functions; the one we refer to here is coded in the `arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S` file. After `setup()` terminates, the function has been moved either to physical address 0x00100000 or to physical address 0x00001000, depending on whether the kernel image was loaded high or low in RAM.

内核代码中有2个不同的`startup_32()`函数，首先，调用的这个位于`arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S`文件中。`setup()`函数执行完之后，函数即可以跳转到物理地址0x00100000处，也可以跳转到物理地址0x00001000处，这完全依赖于内核是被加载到高内存区域还是低内存区域。

This function performs the following operations:

这个函数执行的主要内容如下：

1. Initializes the segmentation registers and a provisional stack.

    初始化段寄存器和临时堆栈。

2. Clears all bits in the eflags register.

    清除`eflags`寄存器中的所有位。

3. Fills the area of uninitialized data of the kernel identified by the `_edata` and `_end` symbols with zeros (see the section “Physical Memory Layout” in Chapter 2).

    将内核中未初始化的数据填充为0，也就是符号`_edata`和`_end`指定的区域（参见[第2章 物理内存分布](#2.5.3)）。

4. Invokes the decompress_kernel() function to decompress the kernel image. The “Uncompressing Linux...” message is displayed first. After the kernel image is decompressed, the “OK, booting the kernel.” message is shown. If the kernel image was loaded low, the decompressed kernel is placed at physical address 0x00100000. Otherwise, if the kernel image was loaded high, the decompressed kernel is placed in a temporary buffer located after the compressed image. The decompressed image is then moved into its final position, which starts at physical address 0x00100000.

    调用解压缩函数`decompress_kernel()`函数解压内核镜像。

    首先，会显示：

        Uncompressing Linux...

    然后，解压缩完成后，显示：

        OK, booting the kernel.

    如果内核镜像被加载到低地址空间，解压缩后的内核被放置到地址0x00100000处。否则，如果内核镜像被加载到高地址空间，解压缩后的内核被放置到压缩内核镜像的后面的临时缓存中。然后，解压缩后的镜像会被移动到最后的位置，也就是开始地址0x00100000处。

5. Jumps to physical address 0x00100000.

    然后，跳转到物理地址0x00100000处。

The decompressed kernel image begins with another startup_32() function included in the `arch/i386/kernel/head.S` file. Using the same name for both the functions does not create any problems (besides confusing our readers), because both functions are executed by jumping to their initial physical addresses.

解压缩后的内核从另一个`startup_32()`函数开始执行，该函数位于`arch/i386/kernel/head.S`文件中。使用相同的函数名称不会产生问题（可能影响我们阅读代码），因为它们都是跳到各自的初始物理地址处执行。

The second startup_32() function sets up the execution environment for the first Linux process (process 0). The function performs the following operations:

第二个函数`startup_32()`函数建立第一个Linux进程（进程0）的运行环境。函数执行下面的操作：

1. Initializes the segmentation registers with their final values.

    使用最终的值，初始化段寄存器。

2. Fills the bss segment of the kernel (see the section “Program Segments and Process Memory Regions” in Chapter 20) with zeros.

    初始化内核的`bss`段为0（参见[第20章 程序段和进程内存区域](#20.1.5)）

3. Initializes the provisional kernel Page Tables contained in `swapper_pg_dir` and `pg0` to identically map the linear addresses to the same physical addresses, as explained in the section “Kernel Page Tables” in Chapter 2.

    初始化包含在`swapper_pg_dir`和`pg0`中的临时内核页表，以便将线性地址映射到相同的物理地址，如[第2章 内核页表](#2.5.5)所解释的那样。

4. Stores the address of the Page Global Directory in the cr3 register, and enables paging by setting the PG bit in the cr0 register.

    保存页全局目录（PGD）地址到cr3寄存器中，通过设置cr0寄存器中的PG标志，使能分页机制。

5. Sets up the Kernel Mode stack for process 0 (see the section “Kernel Threads” in Chapter 3).

    为进程0设定内核模式堆栈（参见[第3章 内核线程](#3.4.1)）。

6. Once again, the function clears all bits in the eflags register.

    再一次，该函数清除`eflags`中的所有位。

7. Invokes `setup_idt()` to fill the IDT with null interrupt handlers (see the section “Preliminary Initialization of the IDT” in Chapter 4).

    调用`setup_idt()`，使用空中断处理函数初始化IDT表（参见[第4章 IDT表的空初始化](#4.4.2)）。

8. Puts the system parameters obtained from the BIOS and the parameters passed to the operating system into the first page frame (see the section “Physical Memory Layout” in Chapter 2).

    把从BIOS获取的系统参数和要传递给操作系统的参数保存到第一个页帧中（参见[第2章 物理内存布局](#2.5.3)）。

9. Identifies the model of the processor.

    识别CPU模型。

10. Loads the `gdtr` and `idtr` registers with the addresses of the GDT and IDT tables.

    把GDT和IDT表的地址保存到`gdtr`和`idtr`寄存器中。

11. Jumps to the start_kernel() function.

    跳转到`start_kernel()`函数。

<h2 id="21.5">21.5 start_kernel()</h2>

The start_kernel() function completes the initialization of the Linux kernel. Nearly every kernel component is initialized by this function; we mention just a few of them:

`start_kernel()`函数完成Linux内核的初始化。内核的各个组成部分几乎都在这个函数中完成初始化，我们只提及它们中的一些。

1. The scheduler is initialized by invoking the sched_init() function (see Chapter 7).

    调用`sched_init()`函数（参见[第7章 进程调度](#7)，初始化调度器`scheduler`。


2. The memory zones are initialized by invoking the build_all_zonelists() function (see the section “Memory Zones” in Chapter 8).

    调用`build_all_zonelists()`函数（参见[第8章中的内存区](#8.1.3)），初始化内存区。

3. The Buddy system allocators are initialized by invoking the page_alloc_init() and mem_init() functions (see the section “The Buddy System Algorithm” in Chapter 8).

    调用`page_alloc_init()`和`mem_init()`函数（参见[第8章中的伙伴系统算法](#8.1.7)），初始化`伙伴系统分配器`。

4. The final initialization of the IDT is performed by invoking trap_init() (see the section “Exception Handling” in Chapter 4) and init_IRQ() (see the section “IRQ data structures” in Chapter 4).

    调用`trap_init()`（[第4章中的异常处理](#4.5)）和`init_IRQ()`函数（[第4章中的IRQ数据结构](#4.6.1.2)）完成`IDT`最终的初始化

5. The `TASKLET_SOFTIRQ` and `HI_SOFTIRQ` are initialized by invoking the softirq_init() function (see the section “Softirqs” in Chapter 4).

    调用`softirq_init()`函数（[第4章中的IRQ数据结构](#4.7.1)）完成`TASKLET_SOFTIRQ`和`HI_SOFTIRQ`的初始化。

6. The system date and time are initialized by the time_init() function (see the section “The Linux Timekeeping Architecture” in Chapter 6).

    调用`time_init()`函数（[第6章中的Linux计时架构](#6.2)）完成系统日期和时间的初始化。

7. The slab allocator is initialized by the kmem_cache_init() function (see the section “General and Specific Caches” in Chapter 8).

    调用`kmem_cache_init()`函数（[第8章中的通用和特定Cache](#8.2.4)）完成`slab`分配器初始化

8. The speed of the CPU clock is determined by invoking the calibrate_delay() function (see the section “Delay Functions” in Chapter 6).

    调用`calibrate_delay()`函数（[第6章中的延时函数](#6.5.3)）决定CPU时钟速率。

9. The kernel thread for process 1 is created by invoking the kernel_thread() function. In turn, this kernel thread creates the other kernel threads and executes the /sbin/init program, as described in the section “Kernel Threads” in Chapter 3.

    进程1的内核线程通过调用`kernel_thread()`函数创建。这个内核线程会以此创建其它内核线程并执行`/sbin/init`程序，如[第3章内核线程这一节](3.4.2)所描述的那样。

Besides the “Linux version 2.6.11...” message, which is displayed right after the beginning of start_kernel(), many other messages are displayed in this last phase, both by the init program and by the kernel threads. At the end, the familiar login prompt appears on the console (or in the graphical screen, if the X Window System is launched at startup), telling the user that the Linux kernel is up and running.

除了`Linux version 2.6.11...`这条提示信息之外，`start_kernel()`函数执行之后，还会显示一些其它的信息，这些信息都是由init程序和内核线程打印的。最后，熟悉的登陆提示信息就会出现在控制台上（或者在图形界面上，如果X Window系统启动的话），告诉用户Linux内核已经启动并正在运行。
