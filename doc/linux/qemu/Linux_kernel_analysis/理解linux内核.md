In order to thoroughly  understand what makes Linux tick and why it works so well on a wide variety of systems, you need to delve deep into the heart of the kernel. The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, and in what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can share the system efficiently. It expertly organizes data transfers so that the CPU isn't kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow hard disks.

*Understanding the Linux Kernel*, Third Edition, takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights for those who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings [[support with evidence or authority or make more certain or confirm]]() of why Linux does things the way it does.

The third edition of the book covers version 2.6, which has seen signigican changes to nearly every kernel subsystem. particularly in the areas of memory management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics:

* Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct Memory Access(DMA)
* The virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended Filesystem
* Process creation and scheduling
* Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers
* Timing
* Synchronization within the kernel
* Interprocess Communication(IPC)
* Program execution

*Understanding the Linux kernel* will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but it's more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. This book will help you make the most of your Linux system.

<h1 id="1">1 简介</h1>

Linux is a member of the large family of Unix-like operating systems. A relative newcomer experiencing sudden spectacular[[*惊人的*]]() popularity starting in the late 1990s, Linux joins such well-known commercial Unix operating systems as System V Release 4(SVR4), developed by AT&T (now owned by the SCO Group); the 4.4 BSD release from the University of California at Berkeley (4.4BSD); Digital UNIX from Digital Equipment Corporation (now Hewlett-Packard); AIX from IBM; HP-UX from Hewlett-Packard; Solaris from Sun Microsystems; and Mac OS X from Apple Computer, Inc. Beside Linux, a few other opensource Unix-like kernels exist, such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

Linux was initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as an operating system for IBM-compatible personal computers based on the Intel 80386 microprocessor. Linus remains deeply involved with improving Linux, keeping it up-to-date with various hardware developments and coordinating the activity of hundreds of Linux developers around the world. Over the years, developers have worked to make Linux available on other architectures, including Hewlett-Packard’s Alpha, Intel’s Itanium, AMD’s AMD64, PowerPC, and IBM’s zSeries.

One of the more appealing benefits to Linux is that it isn’t a commercial operating system: its source code under the *GNU General Public License (GPL)† *is open and available to anyone to study (as we will in this book); if you download the code (the official site is [http://www.kernel.org](http://www.kernel.org)) or check the sources on a Linux CD, you will be able to explore, from top to bottom, one of the most successful modern operating systems. This book, in fact, assumes you have the source code on hand and can apply what we say to your own explorations.

Technically speaking, Linux is a true Unix kernel, although it is not a full Unix operating system because it does not include all the Unix applications, such as filesystem utilities, windowing systems and graphical desktops, system administrator commands, text editors, compilers, and so on. However, because most of these programs are freely available under the GPL, they can be installed in every Linux-based system.

Because the Linux kernel requires so much additional software to provide a useful environment, many Linux users prefer to rely on commercial distributions, available on CD-ROM, to get the code included in a standard Unix system. Alternatively, the code may be obtained from several different sites, for instance [http://www.kernel.org](http://www.kernel.org). Several distributions put the Linux source code in the */usr/src/linux* directory. In the rest of this book, all file pathnames will refer implicitly to the Linux source code directory.

<h2 id="1.1">1.1 Linux与其它类Unix内核对比</h2>

The various Unix-like systems on the market, some of which have a long history and show signs of archaic practices, differ in many important respects. All commercial variants were derived from either SVR4 or 4.4BSD, and all tend to agree on some common standards like IEEE’s Portable Operating Systems based on Unix (POSIX) and X/Open’s Common Applications Environment (CAE).

The current standards specify only an application programming interface (API)—that is, a well-defined environment in which user programs should run. Therefore, the standards do not impose any restriction on internal design choices of a compliant kernel.

To define a common user interface, Unix-like kernels often share fundamental design ideas and features. In this respect, Linux is comparable with the other Unix-like operating systems. Reading this book and studying the Linux kernel, therefore, may help you understand the other Unix variants, too.

The 2.6 version of the Linux kernel aims to be compliant with the IEEE POSIX standard. This, of course, means that most existing Unix programs can be compiled and executed on a Linux system with very little effort or even without the need for patches to the source code. Moreover, Linux includes all the features of a modern Unix operating system, such as virtual memory, a virtual filesystem, lightweight processes, Unix signals, SVR4 interprocess communications, support for Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) systems, and so on.

When Linus Torvalds wrote the first kernel, he referred to some classical books on Unix internals, like Maurice Bach’s *The Design of the Unix Operating System* (Prentice Hall, 1986). Actually, Linux still has some bias toward the Unix baseline described in Bach’s book (i.e., SVR2). However, Linux doesn’t stick to any particular variant. Instead, it tries to adopt the best features and design choices of several different Unix kernels.

The following list describes how Linux competes against some well-known commercial Unix kernels:

* Monolithic kernel
    
    It is a large, complex do-it-yourself program, composed of several logically different components. In this, it is quite conventional; most commercial Unix variants are monolithic. (Notable exceptions are the Apple Mac OS X and the GNU Hurd operating systems, both derived from the Carnegie-Mellon’s Mach, which follow a microkernel approach.)

* Compiled and statically linked traditional Unix kernels

    Most modern kernels can dynamically load and unload some portions of the kernel code (typically, device drivers), which are usually called modules. Linux’s support for modules is very good, because it is able to automatically load and unload modules on demand. Among the main commercial Unix variants, only the SVR4.2 and Solaris kernels have a similar feature.

* 内核线程
    
    Some Unix kernels, such as Solaris and SVR4.2/MP, are organized as a set of kernel threads. A kernel thread is an execution context that can be independently scheduled; it may be associated with a user program, or it may run only some kernel functions. Context switches between kernel threads are usually much less expensive than context switches between ordinary processes, because the former usually operate on a common address space. Linux uses kernel threads in a very limited way to execute a few kernel functions periodically; however, they do not represent the basic execution context abstraction. (That’s the topic of the next item.)

* 支持多线程应用程序

    Most modern operating systems have some kind of support for multithreaded applications—that is, user programs that are designed in terms of many relatively independent execution flows that share a large portion of the application data structures. A multithreaded user application could be composed of many lightweight processes (LWP), which are processes that can operate on a common address space, common physical memory pages, common opened files, and so on. Linux defines its own version of lightweight processes, which is different from the types used on other systems such as SVR4 and Solaris. While all the commercial Unix variants of LWPare based on kernel threads, Linux regards lightweight processes as the basic execution context and handles them via the nonstandard `clone()` system call.

* 可抢占式内核
    
    When compiled with the “Preemptible Kernel” option, Linux 2.6 can arbitrarily interleave execution flows while they are in privileged mode. Besides Linux 2.6, a few other conventional, general-purpose Unix systems, such as Solaris and Mach 3.0, are fully preemptive kernels. SVR4.2/MP introduces some fixed preemption points as a method to get limited preemption capability.

* 支持多处理器
    
    Several Unix kernel variants take advantage of multiprocessor systems. Linux 2.6 supports symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) for different memory models, including NUMA: the system can use multiple processors and each processor can handle any task—there is no discrimination among them. Although a few parts of the kernel code are still serialized by means of a single “big kernel lock,” it is fair to say that Linux 2.6 makes a near optimal use of SMP.

* 文件系统
    
    Linux’s standard filesystems come in many flavors. You can use the plain old Ext2 filesystem if you don’t have specific needs. You might switch to Ext3 if you want to avoid lengthy filesystem checks after a system crash. If you’ll have to deal with many small files, the ReiserFS filesystem is likely to be the best choice. Besides Ext3 and ReiserFS, several other journaling filesystems can be used in Linux; they include IBM AIX’s Journaling File System (JFS) and Silicon Graphics IRIX’s XFS filesystem. Thanks to a powerful object-oriented Virtual File System technology (inspired by Solaris and SVR4), porting a foreign filesystem to Linux is generally easier than porting to other kernels.

* STREAMS
    
    Linux has no analog to the STREAMS I/O subsystem introduced in SVR4, although it is included now in most Unix kernels and has become the preferred interface for writing device drivers, terminal drivers, and network protocols.

This assessment suggests that Linux is fully competitive nowadays with commercial
operating systems. Moreover, Linux has several features that make it an exciting
operating system. Commercial Unix kernels often introduce new features to gain a
larger slice of the market, but these features are not necessarily useful, stable, or productive.
As a matter of fact, modern Unix kernels tend to be quite bloated. By contrast,
Linux—together with the other open source operating systems—doesn’t suffer
from the restrictions and the conditioning imposed by the market, hence it can freely
evolve according to the ideas of its designers (mainly Linus Torvalds). Specifically,
Linux offers the following advantages over its commercial competitors:

* **Linux is cost-free.** 
    
    You can install a complete Unix system at no expense other than the hardware (of course).

* **Linux is fully customizable in all its components.**
    
    Thanks to the compilation options, you can customize the kernel by selecting only the features really needed. Moreover, thanks to the GPL, you are allowed to freely read and modify the source code of the kernel and of all system programs.

* **Linux runs on low-end, inexpensive hardware platforms.** 
    
    You are able to build a network server using an old Intel 80386 system with 4 MB of RAM.

* **Linux is powerful.**
    
    Linux systems are very fast, because they fully exploit the features of the hardware components. The main Linux goal is efficiency, and indeed many design choices of commercial variants, like the STREAMS I/O subsystem, have been rejected by Linus because of their implied performance penalty.

* **Linux developers are excellent programmers.**
    
    Linux systems are very stable; they have a very low failure rate and system maintenance time.

* **The Linux kernel can be very small and compact.**
    
    It is possible to fit a kernel image, including a few system programs, on just one 1.44 MB floppy disk. As far as we know, none of the commercial Unix variants is able to boot from a single floppy disk.

* **Linux is highly compatible with many common operating systems.**
    
    Linux lets you directly mount filesystems for all versions of MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, SVR4, OS/2, Mac OS X, Solaris, SunOS, NEXTSTEP, many BSD variants, and so on. Linux also is able to operate with many network layers, such as Ethernet (as well as Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet), Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), High Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI), IEEE 802.11 (Wireless LAN), and IEEE 802.15 (Bluetooth). By using suitable libraries, Linux systems are even able to directly run programs written for other operating systems. For example, Linux is able to execute some applications written for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, SVR3 and R4, 4.4BSD, SCO Unix, Xenix, and others on the 80x86 platform.

* **Linux is well supported.**
    
    Believe it or not, it may be a lot easier to get patches and updates for Linux than for any proprietary operating system. The answer to a problem often comes back within a few hours after sending a message to some newsgroup or mailing list. Moreover, drivers for Linux are usually available a few weeks after new hardware products have been introduced on the market. By contrast, hardware manufacturers release device drivers for only a few commercial operating systems—usually Microsoft’s. Therefore, all commercial Unix variants run on a restricted subset of hardware components.

With an estimated installed base of several tens of millions, people who are used to certain features that are standard under other operating systems are starting to expect the same from Linux. In that regard, the demand on Linux developers is also increasing. Luckily, though, Linux has evolved under the close direction of Linus and his subsystem maintainers to accommodate the needs of the masses.

<h2 id="1.3">1.3 Linux版本</h2>

Up to kernel version 2.5, Linux identified kernels through a simple numbering scheme. Each version was characterized by three numbers, separated by periods. The first two numbers were used to identify the version; the third number identified the release. The first version number, namely 2, has stayed unchanged since 1996. The second version number identified the type of kernel: if it was even, it denoted a stable version; otherwise, it denoted a development version.

As the name suggests, stable versions were thoroughly checked by Linux distributors and kernel hackers. A new stable version was released only to address bugs and to add new device drivers. Development versions, on the other hand, differed quite significantly from one another; kernel developers were free to experiment with different solutions that occasionally lead to drastic kernel changes. Users who relied on development versions for running applications could experience unpleasant surprises when upgrading their kernel to a newer release.

During development of Linux kernel version 2.6, however, a significant change in the version numbering scheme has taken place. Basically, the second number no longer identifies stable or development versions; thus, nowadays kernel developers introduce large and significant changes in the current kernel version 2.6. A new kernel 2.7 branch will be created only when kernel developers will have to test a really disruptive change; this 2.7 branch will lead to a new current kernel version, or it will be backported to the 2.6 version, or finally it will simply be dropped as a dead end.

The new model of Linux development implies that two kernels having the same version but different release numbers—for instance, 2.6.10 and 2.6.11—can differ significantly even in core components and in fundamental algorithms. Thus, when a new kernel release appears, it is potentially unstable and buggy. To address this problem, the kernel developers may release patched versions of any kernel, which are identified by a fourth number in the version numbering scheme. For instance, at the time this paragraph was written, the latest “stable” kernel version was 2.6.11.12. Please be aware that the kernel version described in this book is Linux 2.6.11.


<h2 id="1.4">1.4 操作系统基本概念</h2>

Each computer system includes a basic set of programs called the operating system. The most important program in the set is called the kernel. It is loaded into RAM when the system boots and contains many critical procedures that are needed for the system to operate. The other programs are less crucial utilities; they can provide a wide variety of interactive experiences for the user—as well as doing all the jobs the user bought the computer for—but the essential shape and capabilities of the system are determined by the kernel. The kernel provides key facilities to everything else on the system and determines many of the characteristics of higher software. Hence, we often use the term “operating system” as a synonym for “kernel.”

The operating system must fulfill two main objectives:

* Interact with the hardware components, servicing all low-level programmable elements included in the hardware platform.

* Provide an execution environment to the applications that run on the computer system (the so-called user programs).

Some operating systems allow all user programs to directly play with the hardware components (a typical example is MS-DOS). In contrast, a Unix-like operating system hides all low-level details concerning the physical organization of the computer from applications run by the user. When a program wants to use a hardware resource, it must issue a request to the operating system. The kernel evaluates the request and, if it chooses to grant the resource, interacts with the proper hardware components on behalf of the user program.

To enforce this mechanism, modern operating systems rely on the availability of specific hardware features that forbid user programs to directly interact with low-level hardware components or to access arbitrary memory locations. In particular, the hardware introduces at least two different execution modes for the CPU: a nonprivileged mode for user programs and a privileged mode for the kernel. Unix calls these User Mode and Kernel Mode, respectively.

In the rest of this chapter, we introduce the basic concepts that have motivated the design of Unix over the past two decades, as well as Linux and other operating systems. While the concepts are probably familiar to you as a Linux user, these sections try to delve into them a bit more deeply than usual to explain the requirements they place on an operating system kernel. These broad considerations refer to virtually all Unix-like systems. The other chapters of this book will hopefully help you understand the Linux kernel internals.

<h3 id="1.4.1">1.4.1 多用户系统</h3>

A multiuser system is a computer that is able to concurrently and independently execute several applications belonging to two or more users. Concurrently means that applications can be active at the same time and contend for the various resources such as CPU, memory, hard disks, and so on. Independently means that each application can perform its task with no concern for what the applications of the other users are doing. Switching from one application to another, of course, slows down each of them and affects the response time seen by the users. Many of the complexities of modern operating system kernels, which we will examine in this book, are present to minimize the delays enforced on each program and to provide the user with responses that are as fast as possible.

Multiuser operating systems must include several features:

* An authentication mechanism for verifying the user’s identity

* protection mechanism against buggy user programs that could block other applications running in the system

* A protection mechanism against malicious user programs that could interfere with or spy on the activity of other users

* An accounting mechanism that limits the amount of resource units assigned to each user

To ensure safe protection mechanisms, operating systems must use the hardware protection associated with the CPU privileged mode. Otherwise, a user program would be able to directly access the system circuitry and overcome the imposed bounds. Unix is a multiuser system that enforces the hardware protection of system resources.

<h3 id="1.4.2">1.4.2 用户和组的概念</h3>

In a multiuser system, each user has a private space on the machine; typically, he owns some quota of the disk space to store files, receives private mail messages, and so on. The operating system must ensure that the private portion of a user space is visible only to its owner. In particular, it must ensure that no user can exploit a system application for the purpose of violating the private space of another user.

All users are identified by a unique number called the *User ID*, or *UID*. Usually only a restricted number of persons are allowed to make use of a computer system. When one of these users starts a working session, the system asks for a login name and a password. If the user does not input a valid pair, the system denies access. Because the password is assumed to be secret, the user’s privacy is ensured.

To selectively share material with other users, each user is a member of one or more user groups, which are identified by a unique number called a *user group ID*. Each file is associated with exactly one group. For example, access can be set so the user owning the file has read and write privileges, the group has read-only privileges, and other users on the system are denied access to the file.

Any Unix-like operating system has a special user called *root* or *superuser*. The system administrator must log in as root to handle user accounts, perform maintenance tasks such as system backups and program upgrades, and so on. The root user can do almost everything, because the operating system does not apply the usual protection mechanisms to her. In particular, the root user can access every file on the system and can manipulate every running user program.

All operating systems use one fundamental abstraction: the *process*. A process can be defined either as “an instance of a program in execution” or as the “execution context” of a running program. In traditional operating systems, a process executes a single sequence of instructions in an address space; the address space is the set of memory addresses that the process is allowed to reference. Modern operating systems allow processes with multiple execution flows—that is, multiple sequences of instructions executed in the same address space.

Multiuser systems must enforce an execution environment in which several processes can be active concurrently and contend for system resources, mainly the CPU. Systems that allow concurrent active processes are said to be multiprogramming or multiprocessing. It is important to distinguish programs from processes; several processes can execute the same program concurrently, while the same process can execute several programs sequentially.

On uniprocessor systems, just one process can hold the CPU, and hence just one execution flow can progress at a time. In general, the number of CPUs is always restricted, and therefore only a few processes can progress at once. An operating system component called the scheduler chooses the process that can progress. Some operating systems allow only nonpreemptable processes, which means that the scheduler is invoked only when a process voluntarily relinquishes the CPU. But processes of a multiuser system must be preemptable; the operating system tracks how long each process holds the CPU and periodically activates the scheduler.

Unix is a multiprocessing operating system with preemptable processes. Even when no user is logged in and no application is running, several system processes monitor the peripheral devices. In particular, several processes listen at the system terminals waiting for user logins. When a user inputs a login name, the listening process runs a program that validates the user password. If the user identity is acknowledged, the process creates another process that runs a shell into which commands are entered. When a graphical display is activated, one process runs the window manager, and each window on the display is usually run by a separate process. When a user creates a graphics shell, one process runs the graphics windows and a second process runs the shell into which the user can enter the commands. For each user command, the shell process creates another process that executes the corresponding program.

Unix-like operating systems adopt a process/kernel model. Each process has the illusion that it’s the only process on the machine, and it has exclusive access to the operating system services. Whenever a process makes a system call (i.e., a request to the kernel, see [Chapter 10](#10)), the hardware changes the privilege mode from User Mode to Kernel Mode, and the process starts the execution of a kernel procedure with a strictly limited purpose. In this way, the operating system acts within the execution context of the process in order to satisfy its request. Whenever the request is fully satisfied, the kernel procedure forces the hardware to return to User Mode and the process continues its execution from the instruction following the system call.

<h3 id="1.4.4">1.4.4 内核架构</h3>

As stated before, most Unix kernels are monolithic: each kernel layer is integrated into the whole kernel program and runs in Kernel Mode on behalf of the current process. In contrast, microkernel operating systems demand a very small set of functions from the kernel, generally including a few synchronization primitives, a simple scheduler, and an interprocess communication mechanism. Several system processes that run on top of the microkernel implement other operating system–layer functions, like memory allocators, device drivers, and system call handlers.

Although academic research on operating systems is oriented toward microkernels, such operating systems are generally slower than monolithic ones, because the explicit message passing between the different layers of the operating system has a cost. However, microkernel operating systems might have some theoretical advantages over monolithic ones. Microkernels force the system programmers to adopt a modularized approach, because each operating system layer is a relatively independent program that must interact with the other layers through well-defined and clean software interfaces. Moreover, an existing microkernel operating system can be easily ported to other architectures fairly easily, because all hardware-dependent components are generally encapsulated in the microkernel code. Finally, microkernel operating systems tend to make better use of random access memory (RAM) than monolithic ones, because system processes that aren’t implementing needed functionalities might be swapped out or destroyed.

To achieve many of the theoretical advantages of microkernels without introducing performance penalties, the Linux kernel offers modules. A module is an object file whose code can be linked to (and unlinked from) the kernel at runtime. The object code usually consists of a set of functions that implements a filesystem, a device driver, or other features at the kernel’s upper layer. The module, unlike the external layers of microkernel operating systems, does not run as a specific process. Instead, it is executed in Kernel Mode on behalf of the current process, like any other statically linked kernel function.

使用模块主要有以下优点：

* 模块化方法

    Because any module can be linked and unlinked at runtime, system programmers must introduce well-defined software interfaces to access the data structures handled by modules. This makes it easy to develop new modules.

* 平台独立

    Even if it may rely on some specific hardware features, a module doesn’t depend on a fixed hardware platform. For example, a disk driver module that relies on the SCSI standard works as well on an IBM-compatible PC as it does on Hewlett-Packard’s Alpha.

* 节省内存使用

    A module can be linked to the running kernel when its functionality is required and unlinked when it is no longer useful; this is quite useful for small embedded systems.

* 没有性能损失

    Once linked in, the object code of a module is equivalent to the object code of the statically linked kernel. Therefore, no explicit message passing is required when the functions of the module are invoked.

<h2 id="1.5">1.5 Unix文件系统综述</h2>

The Unix operating system design is centered on its filesystem, which has several interesting characteristics. We’ll review the most significant ones, since they will be mentioned quite often in forthcoming chapters.

<h3 id="1.5.1">1.5.1 文件</h3>

A Unix file is an information container structured as a sequence of bytes; the kernel
does not interpret the contents of a file. Many programming libraries implement
higher-level abstractions, such as records structured into fields and record addressing
based on keys. However, the programs in these libraries must rely on system calls
offered by the kernel. From the user’s point of view, files are organized in a treestructured
namespace, as shown in Figure 1-1.
