MIPS is the most elegant among the effective RISC architectures; even the competition thinks so, as evidenced by the strong MIPS influence seen in later architectures like DEC’s Alpha and HP’s Precision. Elegance by itself doesn’t get you far in a competitive marketplace, but MIPS microprocessors have usually managed to be among the fastest of each generation by remaining among the simplest.

Relative simplicity was a commercial necessity for MIPS, which spun off from an academic project as a small design group using multiple semiconductor partners to make and market the chips. As a result the architecture has the largest range of active manufacturers in the industry - working from ASIC cores (LSI Logic, Toshiba, Philips, NEC) through low-cost CPUs (iDT, LSI) and from low-end 64-bit (IDT, NKK, NEC) to the top (NEC, Toshiba, and IDT).

At the low end the CPU is 1.5 mm2 (rapidly disappearing from sight in the “system on a chip”); at the high end the R10000 is nearly an inch square and generates 30W of heat — and when first launched was probably the fastest CPU on the planet. And although MIPS looks like an outsider, sales volumes seem healthy enough: 44M MIPS CPUs were shipped in 1997, mostly into embedded applications.

The MIPS CPU is one of the RISC CPUs, born out of a particularly fertile period of academic research and development. RISC(reduced instruction set computer) is an attractive acronym that, like many such, probably obscures reality more than it reveals it. But it does serve as a useful tag for a number of new CPU architectures launched between 1986 and 1989, which owe their remarkable performance to ideas developed a few years earlier by a couple of seminal research projects. Someone commented that “a RISC is any computer architecture defined after 1984”; although meant as a jibe at the industry’s use of the acronym, the comment is also true — no computer defined after 1984 can afford to ignore the RISC pioneers’ work.

One of these pioneering projects was the MIPS project at Stanford. Theproject name MIPS (named for the key phrase microcomputer without interlocked pipeline stages) is also a pun on the familiar unit ”millions of instructions per second” The Stanford group’s work showed that pipelining, although a well-known technique, had been drastically underexploited by earlier architectures and could be much better used, particularly when combined with 1980 silicon design.
