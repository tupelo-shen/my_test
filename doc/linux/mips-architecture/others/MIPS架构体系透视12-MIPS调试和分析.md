When you build a low-cost, low-power embedded device or consumer gizmo, it makes sense to squeeze out every feature that doesn’t contribute to the final application.

Or does it?

In marketing terms, the way to make money out of these kinds of devices is to be there first: As the devices become familiar, prices drop rapidly (as has happened with DVD players, for example). Product lifetimes are short, so development timescales must be compressed.

There’s a tension here: A cut-to-the-bone hardware system is a hostile base for development and test. The economics of SoC chips offers a way out. Most SoCs can accommodate a few percent more transistors used for predefined functions with no impact on production cost, because the transistor count is limited by the difficulty of designing circuits and making reasonably sure the chip will work first time. If the suppliers of SoC components can include development aids without passing on much risk to the SoC builder, everyone might win.
