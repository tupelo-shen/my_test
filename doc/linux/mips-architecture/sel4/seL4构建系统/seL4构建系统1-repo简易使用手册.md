## 1 Repo简介

Repo is a tool developed by the Android Open Source Project. We use repo for source dependency management.

This page describes how we typically structure our manifests and also explains some common repo commands that we use in our workflows.

Below is an example of a manifest for the sel4test project. It is located in [https://github.com/seL4/sel4test-manifest](https://github.com/seL4/sel4test-manifest)

## 2 Manifest layout

We provide a brief overview of manifests as used in our projects in this section, please find more details in the full description of the manifest layout which can be found [here](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/+/master/docs/manifest-format.md).

```xml
<remote name="seL4" fetch="." />
```

The remote element specifies a remote where git repositories can be found.

```xml
<project name="musllibc.git" remote="seL4" path="projects/musllibc" revision="sel4"/>
```

The `project` element declares a repository.

* `name` is the repository name at the `remote`
* `path` is the repository checkout location relative to the directory the project was initialised in.
* `revision` specifies what version of the repository to use. Branches and revision hashes are supported.
* `Tags` are supported but the attribute value must be structured as `refs/tags/tagname`.
* `linkfile` element specifies a symlink from the repository to somewhere else in the project layout.
    - `src` is a path relative to the repository checkout.
    - `dest` is a path relative to the project directory.


```xml
<default revision="master" remote="seL4"/>
```

The `default` element specifies attribute defaults that may be ommitted from `project` elements. If attributes are ommitted, the values from the default element will be used instead.

A pinned manifest uses pinned git revisions for all of its repositories. It is good practice to create a pinned manifest that refers to a working version of a project. For projects that we maintain, we provide at least two manifests: default.xml and master.xml (See [ReleaseProcess](https://docs.sel4.systems/ReleaseProcess) for more information about what manifests we make available).

## 4 命令

#### 4.1 init和sync

`repo init` and `repo sync` are the most commonly used commands. Their purpose is for selecting a manifest and downloading all of the repositories and setting up a project directory structure. Often project READMEs will provide the following instructions:

```
mkdir source_dir
cd source_dir
repo init -u https://github.com/seL4/sel4test-manifest.git
repo sync
```

This will initialise a new directory with the git repos checked out in the locations described by the manifest file.

`init` is for selecting a manifest to use, and `sync` is for checking out that manifest.

* init
    - `-u` git url. Note: GitHub ssh urls do not work using the generated URL they provide:`git@github.com:seL4/sel4test-manifest.git` has to be changed to `ssh://git@github.com/seL4/sel4test-manifest.git`
    - `-m` manifest name, default is `default.xml`.
    - `-b` branch or revision, or tag if using format `refs/tags/tagname`. Default is `default.xml`

* sync
    
    This command synchronises your project directory with what the manifest describes. If you have made commits in your branches, this may result in them getting lost as repo switches the HEAD back to what the manifest describes. If this happens, use `git reflog` to find the untracked commit, or use branches to keep track of commits as branches will remain in your local checkouts.

    `sync` has several flags for specifying how to checkout from remotes such as `-j` for parallel checkouts. Use `repo sync --help` for a list and description.

#### 4.2 diff和status

These two commands are similar to running git diff or git status in every git repository.

#### 4.3 diffmanifests

This command allows you to list the commit differences between two manifests of the same project.

## 5 FAQ

#### 5.1 How do I check out a released version of a project such as seL4test?

```
repo init -u https://github.com/seL4/sel4test-manifest.git -b refs/tags/
repo sync
```

#### 5.2 How do I change manifests of an already checked out project?

```
repo init -m master.xml
repo sync
```

> This will change from the current manifest to `master.xml` in the manifest repository

#### 5.3 How do I create a pinned manifest?

```
repo manifest -r -o pinned.xml
```

#### 5.4 Is there a faster way to checkout and sync a project?

```
repo init -u https://github.com/seL4/sel4test-manifest.git --no-clone-bundle --depth=1
repo sync --jobs=8 --fetch-submodules --current-branch --no-clone-bundle
```
