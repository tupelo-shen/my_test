<h1 align="center">Host to Monitor Connection</h1>
<!--INDEX "Host to Monitor connection" -->

<p>The connection between the Host and the debug <a href="mondef.htm">Monitor</a> requires
one serial port, and optionally an Ethernet connection or a second serial port.</p>

<h2>RS232 Serial Port</h2>
<!--INDEX RS232 -->

<p>This connection is used for all command information that passes between the host and
the debug monitor. This port is also used for downloading if there is no Ethernet link or
second serial port. </p>

<p>The <a href="bauds.htm">baud</a> rate used for this connection defaults to 9600.
However, most systems will work satisfactorily up too 38400. </p>

<h2>Ethernet Link (optional)</h2>

<p>This connection can be used for fast <a href="netboot.htm">downloads</a>. It 
  only supports the UDP protocol used by tftp, and is not presently supported 
  by the source-level debuggers.</p>

<h2>Second Serial Port (optional)</h2>
<!--INDEX "Second serial port" -->

<p>This connection can be used for downloading on UNIX hosts. It's advantage is that it
provides a more reliable flowcontrol mechanism than that available from <a
href="tiphelp.htm">tip</a>.</p>
