		Host to Monitor Connection
		Host to Monitor Connection

The connection between the Host and the debug Monitor requires one serial
port, and optionally an Ethernet connection or a second serial port.

RS232 Serial Port

This connection is used for all command information that passes between
the host and the debug monitor. This port is also used for downloading
if there is no Ethernet link or second serial port. 

The baud rate used for this connection defaults
to 9600. However, most systems will work satisfactorily up too 38400. 

Ethernet Link (optional)

This connection can be used for fast 
downloads. It only supports the UDP protocol
used by tftp, and is not presently supported by the source-level
debuggers.

Second Serial Port (optional)

This connection can be used for edown on UNIX hosts. It's advantage
is that it provides a more reliable flowcontrol mechanism than that
available from tip.
