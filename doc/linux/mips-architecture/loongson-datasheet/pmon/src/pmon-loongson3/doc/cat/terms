	Terminal Emulators

A terminal emulator can provide assembly-level debugging. It permits the
user to display/set registers and memory, and to single step and set
breakpoints. In this mode you can use global symbols, but you can't
use local variable names. A Terminal Emulator is often used to 
send a file to the Target.

For more program-specific information, please select the appropriate
program below.

  »  Terminal (Windows 3.x)
  »  Hyperterminal (Windows 95)
  »  Crosstalk (MSDOS, Windows 3.x, Windows 95)
  »  Procomm (MSDOS, Windows 3.x, Windows 95)
  »  tip (UNIX)

Note that the Monitor does not require any
specific type of Terminal Emulation, but vt100 is always a safe choice
if you need to make one.

You should configure the terminal emulator on your Host for 9600 baud,
8 bits data, no parity, 1 stop bit, and whatever communication port you
chose on the back of your Host, turn on the power to your
SerialICE Controller/Target, and you should see a banner that looks something
like this:

	IMON version 5.1.0 [EB], LSI LOGIC Corp. Wed Mar 19 13:01:41 1997

	IMON 

If you don't see this display, you might need to use a special cable to satify the requirements of your
host's hardware flow control scheme (even if it has been disabled).
