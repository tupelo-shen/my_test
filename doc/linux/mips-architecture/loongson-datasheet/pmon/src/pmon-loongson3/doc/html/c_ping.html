<h2> Functional Description</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The ping command is used to verify ether net network connections and setup. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes use of a feature of the ICMP protocol, which is used by hosts and 
  gateways for low-level administrative chores. Each ICMP host is required to 
  respond to an ECHO_REQUEST datagram with an ECHO_RESPONSE. ECHO_REQUEST datagrams 
  (‘‘pings’’) have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a time and then an arbitrary 
  number of ‘‘pad’’ bytes used to fill out the packet. The command continues pinging 
  until interrupted by a Control-C. </p>
<p>When using ping for fault isolation, start by pinging <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">127.0.0.1</font> 
  (a universal self-address, by internet convention.) This verifies that at least 
  the onboard setup is workable. Then, hosts and gateways further and further 
  away should be ‘‘pinged’’. Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed. 
  If duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the packet loss 
  calculation, although the round trip time of these packets is used in calculating 
  the minimum/average/maximum round-trip time numbers. When the program is terminated 
  by a Control-C a brief summary is displayed. </p>
<p>Ping will report duplicate and damaged packets. Duplicate packets ‘‘should 
  never happen’’: they’d have to be gateway problems. Tell your network manager. 
</p>
<p>Damaged packets (data doesn’t look like it should) are serious cause for alarm 
  and often indicate broken hardware&nbsp; somewhere in the ping packet’s path 
  (in the network or in the hosts). </p>
