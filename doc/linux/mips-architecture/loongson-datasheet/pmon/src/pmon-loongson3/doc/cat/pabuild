	Building an Application for Execution under PMON

To build an application for execution under PMON, you should use the pmcc command. This command "knows" about the
requirements of the PMON execution environment, and will use the
correct include files, startup file, and run-time library.

Before you use the pmcc command, you will need to set your environment in order to add the pmcc
command to your command search path.

The pmcc command accepts most of the usual options that are recognized
by a UNIX-style "cc" command. For example, you may..

  »  specify multiple modules that can be either, .c, .s, or .o files.
  »  name the output file using "-o filename".
  »  stop at a .o file using the "-c" option.
  »  specify that the compiler should include full debugging information
by using the "-g" option.

Please refer to the pmcc documentation for a
complete listing of the options supported by this command.

For example, to build a simple "Hello world" program, you would type:

	pmcc -o hello hello.c

The above command produces three files: bubble, bubble.map, and
bubble.rec. The file bubble contains the linked and located object code, bubble.map contains a global
symbol map, and bubble.rec contains the downloadable records.

Note that if you are using a source-level debugger as you host-resident
debugger, you will also need to specify the "-g" option. For example,

	pmcc -g -o hello hello.c

In general it is better to place all of the options before the list of
files.
