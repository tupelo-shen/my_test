The m Command
m

The m command displays and modifies memory. 

Format

The format for the m command is:

m [-bhw] [adr [hexval|-s str]..]

where:

-b	is a flag signifying that byte accesses are to be used.

-h	is a flag signifying that halfword accesses are to be used.

-w	is a flag signifying that word accesses are to be used.

adr	is the memory address to display or modify without entering 
interactive mode.

hexval	is the value to insert at the specified address.

-s	is a flag signifying that the following parameter is a string 
value.

str	is a string value to copy to the specified address.

	enters interactive mode.

=	in interactive mode, reads current address again.

^|-	in interactive mode, moves back one word.

.	exits interactive mode.

Entering no values with this command causes the command to operate in 
interactive mode.

Functional Description

This command can display and then modify memory locations
interactively. This command can also set memory to a specified value
directly.

If invoked with one or more values following the address, the command is 
executed immediately, without entering the interactive mode.

If the command is invoked without a value, the command enters the
interactive memory mode. In interactive memory mode, the user enters a
command at the cursor. The interactive memory mode first displays the
address and its current value. Interactive memory mode then lets the
user select one of the commands listed in the following table.

If the -s option is specified, the Monitor
displays the memory contents as an ASCII string. A multiple-word string
may be specified by enclosing the multiple-word string in quotation
marks.

Examples illustrating the use of the m command follow.
