<h1 align="center">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<p>This section of our PMON/2000 Web-site is devoted to questions that frequently 
  arise, but have readily available answers.</p>
<p>Although most questions can be answered by reading the on-line Web-site documentation 
  suite for PMON/2000, some are not so easily understood. In fact, if you are 
  new to PMON/2000 then this set of pages will be very helpful. We are also developing 
  a Discussion Forum Section that will serve as a central conversation area for 
  users of, and contributirs to PMON/2000.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Lets get rigtht to the good stuff.</b></p>
<p><b>Q:</b> I tried using the '<a href="c_load.htm">load</a>' command to get 
  a binary image from my host server, but nothing gets downloaded across the network 
  - and my console hangs. Is PMON broken?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> The '<a href="c_load.htm">load</a>' command operates on serial ports 
  only. To use '<a href="c_load.htm">load</a>' correctly, the '<a href="c_set.htm">env</a>' 
  variable hostport should only be set to <b>tty0</b> or <b>tty1</b>. Then '<a href="c_load.htm">load</a>' 
  will transfer an '<a href="srec.htm">S-Record</a>' of '<a href="frec.htm">Fast 
  Load Format</a>' image across the serial port you choose. To load over Ethernet 
  the '<a href="netboot.htm">netboot</a>' or '<a href="boot.htm">boot</a>' shortcut 
  should be used.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> I just changed my 'ipaddr' and 'gateway' variables in the environment 
  so I could netboot a new application from a remote host. My PMON/2000 board 
  still cannot see the network host and reports &quot;Network not reachable.&quot; 
  What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Currently PMON/2000 must also be restarted if '<a href="c_set.htm">ipaddr</a>' 
  or '<a href="c_set.htm">gateway</a>' is changed. The built-in 'ifconfig' function, 
  which sets up the Networking interface, is run during the board initialization. 
  We are looking into a procedure that will allow changing these parameters at 
  run-time. This would be more consistent with the behaviour of real operating 
  systems (Windows not included, of course).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Q</b>: I want to download an ELF 32-Bit binary image across the serial port, 
  but it will not work. Why?</p>
<p><b>A</b>: Downloading binary files over serial ports does not yet work. A method 
  using the Zmodem protocol will be implemented in the next major revision. Currently 
  serial port downloading only works with '<a href="srec.htm">S-records</a>' or 
  '<a href="frec.htm">fastload</a>' format. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Q: </b>I have tried to download from an NT host, but it fails. Is there 
  any special directory, or file pathname convention needed?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> This is likely to be a problem if the file in question is outside 
  of the default location for your '<a href="tftpd.htm">tftpd</a>' on the WindowsNT 
  machine. PMON/2000 is a native child of the Unix world and, as such, expects 
  filename and pathname conventions that use forward slash (&quot;/&quot;) as 
  a seperator for pathname elements. WindowsNT does not conform to this standard. 
  Try putting the file in question into the base directory location that your 
  '<a href="tftpd.htm">tftpd</a>' server on the WindowsNT machine uses as a starting 
  point for finding files that are requested.</p>
