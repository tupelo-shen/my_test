The set Command
set

The set command sets and displays environment variables.

Format

The format for this command is:

	set [name [value]]
	set nvram [cmdlist]

where:

name	is the name of the environment variable to set.

value	is the string to which the environment variable is set.

nvram	causes the environment 
variables and stty settings to be copied into NVRAM.

cmdlist	is the list of  PROM Monitor commands to be executed 
following reset.  

Entering the set command with no arguments displays all the current 
environment variables.

Functional Description

The set command is used to set or display environment variable values, to 
copy the settings of environment variables and terminal options to 
NVRAM, and to specify a list of commands to be executed by the PROM 
Monitor following reset.  

In some cases, when the Monitor displays a
variable's current value, the Monitor prints a
list of allowed values enclosed in square brackets; in other cases, no
list is shown. In general, when the value is a numeric value, or when
the value has an unlimited range of possible values, no list is shown.

The set command does not evaluate the specified value or check the 
specified value against a list of allowed values. Value checking is only 
performed when a command uses a variable. 

To set a variable to a multiple-word value, enclose the value in single or 
double quotation marks.  

When used with the nvram option, the set command copies the current
settings of the environments variables and the terminal options as
specified in the stty command into NVRAM. The optional command list
permits the user to specify  PROM Monitor
commands that will be executed following reset.  This option requires
that the flash memories support sector erase.  

To avoid reading the NVRAM during power-up, hold the console return 
key down while releasing reset. After repeating this process several times, 
you will see the following message:

Skip NVRAM read? (y/n)? 
 

If you type `y', the booting process will proceed without reading the 
NVRAM.  

Examples illustrating the use of the set command follow.

	PMON set	Display all current values.
	    brkcmd = "l @pc 1"
	    datasz = -b          [-b -h -w]
	   inalpha = hex         [hex symbol]
	    inbase = 16          [auto 8 10 16]
	    moresz = 10        
	  regstyle = sw          [hw sw]
	    rptcmd = trace       [off on trace]
	   trabort = ^K        
	     uleof = %         
	      ulcr = off         [off on]
	   validpc = "_ftext etext"
	   heaptop = 80020000  
	    dlecho = off         [off on lfeed]
	   dlproto = EtxAck      [none XonXoff EtxAck]
	  hostport = tty1      
	    prompt = "PMON "
	 etheraddr = aa:bb:cc:00:00:00
	    ipaddr = 71.0.0.211
	      diag = 0           [N[:dev]]

	PMON set moresz	Display current moresz.
	moresz = 10 

	PMON set moresz 20	Set moresz to 20 decimal.

Display current value of Cause Register and display all 
general-purpose registers: 

	PMON set brkcmd "l @epc 1;r cause;r"

Environment variables can be set and displayed using the 
set command.

Brief descriptions of each of the variables follow, together 
with references to their complete descriptions.

  »      brkcmd - This variable specifies a sequence of Monitor commands
	that are executed when a breakpoint halts program execution. See the b command.

  »      datasz - This variable controls whether data is displayed in
	byte, half-word, or word groups. See the d
	command.

  »      dlecho - This variable controls whether the target board echoes
	on downloads. An entire line can be echoed, a single line-feed
	character can be echoed, or there can be no echo at all. See the load command and the section on 
	flow control.

  »      dlproto - This variable selects the download protocol for
	transfers via RS-232C. The Monitor supports Xon/Xoff and EtxAck
	download protocols. See the load command
	and the section on
	flow control.

  »      etheraddr - This variable specifies the hardware Ethernet
	address. See the load command and the
	section on downloading
	via Ethernet.

  »      ipaddr - This variable specifies the Internet Protocol
	address. See the load command and the
	section on downloading
	via Ethernet.

  »  	heaptop - This variable specifies the highest allowable address in the 
	heap maintained by the PROM Monitor. See the 
	load command.  

  »      hostport - This variable selects whether tty0, tty1, or
	ethernet is the host port. See the load
	command and the section on 
	flow control.

  »  	inalpha - This variable selects whether strings starting with the ASCII 
	characters a, b, c, d, e, and f are interpreted as symbols or 
	hexadecimal numbers. See the sh command.

  »  	inbase - This variable selects the default input base for numeric 
	values. 
	Users can input octal, decimal, or hexadecimal numbers by changing 
	this variable. See the sh command.

  »  	moresz - This variable specifies how many lines to display during 
	screen-at-a-time display. See the more 
	command.

  »      prompt - This variable defines the Monitor 
	prompt. An example of using this command is when you need to
	set the prompt to "PMON " for compatibility with a source-level
	debugger. To do this use the following commands.

	
		IMON set prompt "PMON "
		IMON set nvram
	

	This will set the prompt to "PMON " (note the space) and save this
	new value in the non-volatile memory (if supported).

  »  	regstyle - This variable defines whether hardware or software names 
	are displayed for the LR33000 registers in the l command. See the 
	l command.

  »  	rptcmd - When this variable is set to "on," the previous command is 
	executed again when the user enters an empty line. See the 
	sh command.

  »  	trabort - This variable selects the character that terminates 
	transparent mode and returns the Monitor 
	to command mode. See 
	the tr command.

  »  	ulcr - This variable defines whether there is a carriage return 
	or both a carriage return and a linefeed character at the end of 
	the line during dumps. See the dump 
	command.

  »      uleof - This variable specifies a string that is sent to
	the host after a dump to the target has completed. See the 
	dump command.  

  »  	validpc - This variable specifies the range of valid PC values during 
	program tracing. See the trace command.

  »  	diag - This variable specifies the diagnostic level. zero is off,
	non-zero is on. Valid values are 0 thru 9. By default the
	diagnostic output is sent to the console. However, you may
	direct it to another port. For example,

	PMON set diag 2:/dev/tty1
