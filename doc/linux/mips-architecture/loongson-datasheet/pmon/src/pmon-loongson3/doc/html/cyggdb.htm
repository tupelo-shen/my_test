<!--INDEX "Source-level debug with Cygnus' gdb" -->



To use the debug <a href="mondef.htm">Monitor</a> with GNU's gdb,

connect the serial port that gdb will use, to the Monitor's tty0 (the

console) on the target board.  i.e., gdb only uses one serial port.<p>



<!--If necessary, use the <a href="c_set.htm">set</a> command to set your<a href="mondef.htm">Monitor</a>'s prompt to "PMON> ".  Gdb ishardwired to expect that string, and will not work with any other value(note the space after the ">").<p>-->



Compile and link your modules with the -g option.  This will generate

the extra information that is required by gdb. For example,<p>



<pre>

	pmcc -g -o bubble bubble.c

</pre>



Invoke gdb.<p>



<pre>

	% mips-lsi-elf-gdb -b 9600 bubble

</pre>



where 'bubble' is the name of the object file that you are debugging.

The option &quot;-b 9600&quot; specifies that 9600 baud will be used for the

Host-to-Target communications.<p>



By default gdb from Cygnus Support runs in a windowed mode. However, it

the time of writing, the windowed mode was incomplete/buggy, so you might

prefer to run it in non-windowed mode. To select non-windowed mode, add

the option -nw to the command line.<p>



<pre>

	% mips-lsi-elf-gdb -nw -b 9600 bubble

</pre>



gdb normally expects your monitor to have a prompt of &quot;PMON&gt; &quot; (note

the space). If your monitor uses a different type of prompt you can

either change it in the Monitor using the <a href="c_set.htm">set</a>

command or tell gdb what prompt to expect.  For example,<p>



<pre>

	(gdb) set monitor-prompt IMON&gt; 

</pre>



Note that this command does <i>not</i> expect quotes around the prompt,

but gdb will take the entire string including trailing spaces. So be careful

to type the string exactly.<p>



Next you must specify the target type, and serial port

that will be used to communicated with the target. For example,<p>



<pre>

	(gdb) target lsi /dev/ttyb

</pre>



this specifies that the target is running LSI Logic's PMON (or IMON),

and that the target is connected to /dev/ttyb on the host. If you are

using <a href="dosdef.htm">MSDOS</a> you will need to specify one of

the COM ports. eg. com1.<p>



To download your program to the Target issue the &quot;load&quot; command. No

arguments are necessary as gdb has all the other information it needs.<p>



<pre>

	(gdb) load

</pre>



If you simply want to run your program, you can just type &quot;run&quot;. But if

as is more likely you want to be able to set breakpoints and single-step

your program, you should type,<p>



<pre>

	(gdb) b main

	(gdb) run

</pre>



this will set a breakpoint at &quot;main&quot; and execute the program until it

reaches that point.<p>



The following table is a summary of the most frequently used commands:<p>

<p>&nbsp; 
<p>When debugging the Host-to-Target communications it is sometimes useful to 
  create of log of all the transactions. The following command writes a log to 
  the file &quot;remote.log&quot;.
<p>



<pre>

	(gdb) set remotelogfile remote.log

</pre>
