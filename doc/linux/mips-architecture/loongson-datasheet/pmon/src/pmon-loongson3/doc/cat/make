		The Make Utility
		The Make Utility

Make is an essential tool for managing large projects. It saves time
by only compiling those modules that have been changed since the last
build. To learn more about make I recommend either of these books.

  »  "Managing Projects with Make", by Andrew Oram and Steve Talbott, published
by O'Reilly & Associates, Inc. ISBN 0-937175-90-0

  »  "Mastering Make", by Clovis L. Tondo et al., published by Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-554619-2.

MSDOS users should note that they *must* use the make utility that is
supplied with Microsoft's Visual C++ package. This utility is named 'nmake',
so everytime they see 'make' in this document, they must substitute
'nmake'.

TechNote: The reason that MSDOS users *must* use nmake, is that
only nmake permits three recursive calls to make, followed by a call
to pmcc, followed by a call to the compiler without running out of memory.
