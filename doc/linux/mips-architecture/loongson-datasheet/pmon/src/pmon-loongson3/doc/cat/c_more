The more Command
more

The more command provides screen-at-a-time control for user input.

Format

The more command is an embedded command and is not accessible to the 
user on the command line.

Functional Description

The more command is not specified by the user on the command line, but 
is implicitly used by certain commands. After displaying the number of 
lines according to the value of the moresz environment variable, the more 
command displays the prompt "more-" Commands that use the more 
command include h, hi, d, l, search, and ls.  

The user can enter the following commands at the "more-" prompt: 

CommandAction
SpacePrint one more page
/strSearch forward for string str
nRepeat last executed search
<CR>Show next line
q
Quit from the more prompt and return to the monitor prompt

The moresz Variable

moresz sets how many lines are displayed on one screen during
screen-at-a-time output. If moresz is set to zero, the screen scrolls
continuously. The ^S or ^Q control sequence must be used to pause the
output, and the ^C control sequence must be used to terminate output.

For example, to set the default number of lines output by the more
command to 12, enter:  

PMON set moresz 12
