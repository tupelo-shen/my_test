		Running the PMON Install Program
		Running the PMON Install Program

Before you can perform this step, you must have installed your  MIPS
"C" compiler, and know where it is located.

To run the Install program type:

	% Install		-- UNIX
	C Install		-- MSDOS

UNIX users should note that this program first attempts to find
a suitable Native C compiler. It first tries "cc", and if that is not
found, it tries "gcc". You can also force it to use a specific compiler
by including it on the command line. For example,

	% Install gcc

Once the Install program starts executing it will display the following
message.

This is the LSIPKG installation program. Use it to specify your tools
and target environment.

For support Call 800-232-MIPS, Fax 408-954-4874, email pjb@lsil.com,
or point your web browser at 'http://www.carmel.com/pmon/'.

For each of the questions that follow, the possible choices available
are shown in square brackets and the default is shown in parentheses.
When given as an option, 'q' allows you to cancel the selection.

This is PMON 5.1.3
The following subpackages have been found:
 
        PMON    - The Prom Monitor (V5.1.3)
        IMON    - The SerialICE Ice Manager (V5.1.2)
        MON     - The Core Debug Monitor (V5.1.0)
        CLIB    - The C Run-time Library (V5.1.0)
        BSPS    - The SerialICE Board Support Packages (V5.1.1)

Is this correct? [y n] (y)  

The purpose of this question is to verify that the install program has
correctly recognized any optional subpackages that may have been
installed.  In most cases you can simply take the default (y) and press
the RETURN key. The next question relates to the toolset you will be
using.

This package can be built using a number of different MIPS
cross compilers. Select one of the following tool types:

1. BSO/Tasking tools
2. Algorithmics tools
3. EPI tools
4. Cygnus Support tools (ELF)

Enter one of the above tool types [1-4 q] (q)  

Your list may look a little different, but in any case all you need to do
is enter a number to indicate which toolset you will be using. For example,
'4' would specific that we were planning to use the ELF toolset 
from Cygnus Support. You will then be asked to specify where the tools
are located.

Where are the tools located?  

For example, if you have installed the tools in C:\cygnus you would 
enter this path here. Next you must specify what type of Target system
you will be using.

Select one of the following target configurations:

1. All Processors Big Endian
2. All Processors Little Endian
3. ATMizer-1 R-T Host
4. ATMizer-1 R-T SAR engine
5. ATMizer-2 R-T Host (4010)
6. ATMizer-2 R-T SAR engine
7. SDP1000 (L64008 MPEG-2 Transport)

Enter your selection [1-7] (1)  

For all Big Endian processors (except the
ATMizer family or L64008) select option 1. For all Little Endian
processors (except the ATMizer Host) select option 2. The Install
program will then display a summary of all the choices you have made.

Your current selections are:

  1. Tools:..................... CYGELF 10. CPU clock frequency:......... AUTO
  2. CPU type: LR33000 LR33050          11. Timing:....................... YES

         LR4010                         13. Ethernet:                         
  3. Devices:                                   SONIC ADDR=0xbc000000         
         dev   type address    baud             HWADDR=aa:bb:cc:00:00:00      
         tty0  2681            9600             SONIC_DW32                    
         tty1  2681 0xbe000000 9600     14. Host download port:..... undefined
  4. Memory addresses:                  15. Download mode:........... Two-port
         ROM=9fc00000 RAM=80000100      16. Target download port:........ tty1
         Client PC=80020000             17. Download protocol:......... EtxAck
  5. Client RAM size:............. AUTO 18. Download records:..... FAST-FORMAT
  6. NVRAM check:.................. YES 19. Fast-record Checksum:......... YES
  7. LR333xx Memory Type:..... TURBORKT 20. Prompt:.................. "PMON "
  8. Floating-point support:...... NONE 21. Endian support:............... Big
  9. Multiply/Divide emulation:... NONE 22. Default Endian:............... Big

Is this correct? [y n 1-22 q] (y)  

This question is asking you to confirm the settings implied by your previous
responses. In most cases you can simply take the default (y) and press the
RETURN key. However, if you need to customize the installation, this is
where you do it.

At this point the Install program will create some files and then
return you to your system's prompt.
