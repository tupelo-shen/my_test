The hi Command
hi

The hi command lists the command history.

Format

The format for the hi command is:

hi [cnt]

where:

cnt	is the number of commands to list.

Entering the command with no parameters lists the last 200 executed com-
mand lines to the screen.

Functional Description

The hi command shows the command history, together with the history 
number for each command, in reverse order (the last command entered is 
listed first; the first command entered is listed last). The command num-
bers are reset to zero each time the system is reset.

Entering the hi command with no arguments lists the last 200 commands. 
This option is useful for determining the history number for a particular 
command.

The user can page through the output of the hi command, one screen at a 
time.

The optional cnt parameter selects a set number of lines to be output.
The history list is intentionally in the reverse order to that used in
a C shell, so that the latest entry is displayed first. If a command
line is identical to the previous command, it is not added to the
command history.

Examples illustrating the use of the hi command follow.
