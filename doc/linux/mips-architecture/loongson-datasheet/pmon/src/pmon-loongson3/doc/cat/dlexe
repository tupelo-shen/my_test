	Downloading and Executing Your Application

The procedure used to download and execute your application depends on what
debugger you are using. This debug Monitor
supports either of the following debugger types:

  »  Terminal Emulator 
  »  Source-Level debugger

Download and Execute with a Terminal Emulator

Download

There are three possible choices for downloading your application:

  »  Your Terminal Emulator's Send File command.
  »  Using edown to send the file via a second
serial port.
  »  Using the tftp command via Ethernet.

Execute

If you want to run the entire application to completion, type 'g'. Control
will return to the Monitor's prompt when the
application terminates. For example,

	PMON g
	-- program output if any
	PMON

If you would prefer to be able to single-step your application, and
to possibly set breakpoints, you might prefer to use the following
sequence of commands.

 
PMON g . mainExecute until main
PMON l . 8Disassemble the next 8 instructions
PMON sSingle-step one instruction
PMON c sortContinue until the label sort

For a complete list of the commands available, please refer to the
appropriate PMON or SerialICE command list.
