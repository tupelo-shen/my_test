		Building the PMON package
		Building the PMON package

The steps required to build the PMON package are somewhat host dependent,
so please refer to the appropriate section below:

MSDOS Hosts

  »  If you have a copy of Microsoft's Visual C++ package on your host, perform
the following steps:

  »  Set your environment.
  »  If you don't have a set of PMON ROMS for
your Target board, type

	C nmake pmon-only

   this will build all of the directories needed for PMON. The build
   is controlled by the top-level makefile.
   Or if you already have a set of PMON ROMS
   for your Target board, type 
	C nmake  

  »  If you don't have a copy of Microsoft's Visual C++ package on your host,
perform these alternative steps.

  »  If you don't have a set of PMON ROMS for
you Target board, visit the PMON Web site and collect a prebuilt ROM-image
file. Perform the file extraction in the
top-level directory of this package.

  »  Visit the PMON Web site and pick up a copy of the appropriate prebuilt library
file. Perform the file extraction in the
top-level directory of this package.

UNIX Hosts

  »  Set your environment.
  »  If you don't have a set of PMON ROMS for
your Target board, type

	make pmon-only

   or, if you already have a set of PMON ROMS
   for your Target board, type 
	make  

Finally, if you need to make a set of PMON ROMS
   for your Target board, follow this procedure.
