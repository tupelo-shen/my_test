		Building SerialICE

The steps required to build SerialICE are dependent on whether you have
a native "C" compiler for your host. So please
refer to the appropriate section below. Note that MSDOS users must type "nmake" rather than
"make".

Hosts With a Native "C" Compiler

  »  Set your environment.
  »  Build the run-time library using the following command. Note that
if you unpacked two copies of the source, you must perform this
command in both copies.  Don't forget to use the correct environment for each one.

	make

  »  If you don't have a set of IMON ROMS for
your SerialICE Controller board, type the following command.  Note that if you
unpacked two copies of the source, you must perform this command in
the directory that was configured to match your SerialICE Controller. 

	make imon-only

Then make a set of ROMs for your SerialICE Controller
board. For a "BDMR400x" SerialICE Controller use the file imon/bg/imon.rec.
For a "4010 Nitro" SerialICE Controller use the file imon/lg/imon.rec.

  »  Make a driver and a set of SerialICE Kernel ROMS
for your Target board using the following commands. Note that if you
unpacked two copies of the source, you must make the driver in
the directory that was configured to match your SerialICE Controller, and the
kernel  in the directory that was configured to match your
Target.  

	cd bsps
	make driver kernel

Where driver and kernel are taken from the following
table.

Target Boarddriverkernel
BDMR4001 (Big endian)d4001k4001-be
BDMR4003 (Big endian)d4003k4001-be
BDMR4101 (Big endian)d4101k4001-be
BDMR4001 (Little endian)d4001k4001-le
BDMR4003 (Little endian)d4003k4001-le

4010 Nitro (R4000 Mode)d4010k4010-4k

Hosts Without a Native "C" Compiler

Currently this option is only available for MSDOS users. UNIX users are assumed to have a native "C" compiler.

  »  If you don't have a set of IMON ROMS for
you SerialICE Controller board, visit the PMON Web site,
collect a prebuilt ROM-image file, and unpack it into the top-level directory of the
PMON source package. Note that if you unpacked two copies of the source
package, you must unpack this ROM image into the directory containing
the package configured for your SerialICE Controller.

  »  Visit the PMON Web site, collect
a copy of the appropriate prebuilt run-time library, and unpack it into the top-level directory of the
PMON source package. Note that if you unpacked two copies of the source
package, you must pick up two appropriate copies of the library, and
unpack each of them in their correct directory.

  »  Visit the PMON Web site and pick up a copy of the appropriate prebuilt driver
and kernel for your configuration. 

Then use the kernel file (bsp/k*.rec) to make a set of ROMs for
your Target board.
