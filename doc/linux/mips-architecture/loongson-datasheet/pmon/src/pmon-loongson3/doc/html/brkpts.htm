<!--INDEX "How Breakpoints Work" -->

<hr>

<p>Breakpoints are set using the <a href="c_t.htm">'t'</a>, <a href="c_t.htm">'to'</a>, <a
href="c_b.htm">'b'</a>, <a href="c_g.htm">'g'</a> or <a href="c_c.htm">'c'</a> commands.
The 't', 'to', 'g', and 'c' commands set temporary breakpoints that are automatically
deleted when execution halts. The 'b' command set persistent breakpoints that must be
explicitly deleted (using the <a href="c_db.htm">'db'</a> command).</p>

<p>When the user types a 'b' command to set a breakpoint the <a href="mondef.htm">Monitor</a>
decides which type of breakpoint to utilize using the following algorithm:</p>

<pre>

	if (is_writeable(addr)) bptype = RAM;

	else if (is_cacheable(addr) &amp;&amp; cpu_has_ilock) bptype = ILOCK;

	else if (cpu_has_hwbp) bptype = HW;

	else error();

</pre>

<p>This information is saved in an array. When execution is started, the Monitor walks
through the breakpoint array and implements the breakpoints using the following rules: 

<dl> 
  <dt><b>RAM</b> </dt>
  <dd>Replace the instruction at the specified address with a &quot;break&quot; 
    instruction and save the previous contents (the instruction) so that it can 
    be restored when execution halts. </dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>ILOCK</b> </dt>
  <dd>Use the Icache locking feature to lock a &quot;break&quot; instruction into 
    the Icache at the specified address.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>HW</b> </dt>
  <dd>Program the hardware breakpoint register to generate an exception when execution 
    reaches the specified address.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When an exception is encountered, the processor passes control to the Exception Vector.
The Monitor then restores the previous contents of all breakpoints, and transfers control
to the Shell.</p>

<p>Thus, if the memory is inspected, the break instructions will never be seen, as they
are only present in memory during execution of the application program.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is if the program hangs in such a way as to require the user
to press reset on the target system. In this case the Monitor will &quot;forget&quot; that
breakpoints had been set, and you will see any RAM breakpoints as break instructions in
memory. At this point the application program must be re-downloaded to obtain correct
execution.</p>
