		Installing the SerialICE Driver
		Installing the SerialICE Driver

Before you can use the SerialICE Monitor to communicate with your Target, you
must install an appropriate driver. The steps that you need to perform
are described below.

  »  Open a Terminal window to the SerialICE Controller.
  »  Download the driver.

You may use Ethernet, 
edown, or your Terminal Emulator's
"Send File" feature to do this.

  »  Save the driver in flash memory (optional).

Once the driver has been downloaded, you may choose to save it in the
flash memory to avoid needing to repeat this step. Note that this command
cannot be used after another load command has been issued.

	IMON sdtf		(Save Driver To Flash)

Now that the driver has been placed in flash. You may reload it at
any time by pressing reset, and then typing "load -f". 

  »  Automatic driver install after reset (optional).

Type the following command if you wish the driver to be installed on
powerup (or reset).

	IMON set nvram load -f

Note that if you use this procedure at a later date, you might
notice that the message "verbose: not found" is displayed after reset.
The message is not fatal, and will not effect the correct
working of your board, but it can be avoided by performing a dummy
"set nvram", after powerup, but before a "load -f" is performed.

Now that the driver has been loaded, you may display the Target's
registers and memory.

	IMON r			-- display Target's GP registers
	IMON r *		-- display all of Target's registers
	IMON l bfc00000	-- disassemble starting at 0xbfc00000
	IMON d a0000100	-- display memory starting at 0xa0000100
