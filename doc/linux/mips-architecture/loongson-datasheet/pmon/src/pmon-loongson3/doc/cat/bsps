	Board Support Packages

This package provides several example Board Support Packages (BSPs). Each
BSP consists of a Driver 
and a Kernel. 
The Driver is downloaded to the
SerialICE Controller, whereas the Kernel is "blown" into ROM
and plugged into the Target.

The Driver is specific to a processor but not to a board. The Kernel is
specific to a board (and therefore a processor). For example the module
d4001.c is a driver for the 4001 processor. It contains information
about what registers are present on the processor. Whereas the module
k4001.s is a kernel for the BDMR400x evaluation board, and because of
the similarities it is possible to use this kernel on a BDMR400x fitted
with a 4001, 4002, or 4003 (although you might need to provide
software multiple/divide emulation if your board is equipped with a
4002, or 4003).

MAKE FILES

The following files are used to control the build of this directory. 

  »  readme
  »  makefile
  »  version

By default, the makefile will list all of the possible targets for this
directory.  You can type "make all" to build everything, or if you wish
to build just those files appropriate for a specific target type (eg.
4102), you can type "make 4102", or even "make k4102" if all you need is
the kernel.

KERNEL FILES

These are actually located in the lib directory. But they are built here.
The reason that the source files are located in the lib directory, is that
they are also needed for pmcc's 
"-prom -board xxxx" option.

  »  lib/k4101.s - For BDMR4101
  »  lib/k4011.s - For BDMR4011
  »  lib/k4102.s - For BDMR4102
  »  lib/k64388.s - For 64388 (RAP)
