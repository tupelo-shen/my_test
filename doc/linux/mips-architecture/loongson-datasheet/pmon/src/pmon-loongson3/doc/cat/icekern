		SerialICE Kernels

The SerialICE package provides a number of example SerialICE Kernels. These
are located in the bsps directory. To build an SerialICE Kernel
simply move to the bsps directory and type make. This will list all of
the kernels that are currently provided, together will instructions for
building them. If you have built your own board, you will probably need
to modify the kernel to make it work on
your new board.

Once you have built the S-record file you
are ready to make ROMS.

Operation

Target Design Considerations
SerialICE protocol

The SerialICE Kernel is a small (less than 1K bytes) program that is ROM-resident
on your Target board.

Principle Features:

  »  Neither uses nor flushes the caches - runs from k1seg.
  »  Does initialize at least one block of RAM - this usually just means that
	it initializes the DRAM controller.
  »  Uses Interrupt-driven Serial I/O - Actually interrupts are only used to
	wakeup the kernel when the application is running.
  »  Runs the Application on powerup - If no real application is included 
	in the ROM, the processor sits in a branch-to-self loop until 
	the wakeup request is received.
  »  Does not include software emulation of floating-point or multiply/divide.
  »  Does not include software for instruction emulation.
