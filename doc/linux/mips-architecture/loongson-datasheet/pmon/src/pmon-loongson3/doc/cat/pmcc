The pmcc Command

NAME
     pmcc - A host-resident C compiler driver for producing binaries 
     to run under LSI Logic's PMON, or for a SerialICE debug environment.

SYNOPSIS

pmcc [ -options ] inputfile...

DESCRIPTION
     pmcc is a driver for your  MIPS  C  compiler  that  produces
     binaries to run under LSI Logic's PMON. By default pmcc generates
     three files; the binary (a.out), a downloadable ASCII file
     (a.rec),  and  a  link  map (a.map). If the -o outfile option is
     used  to  rename  the  output  file,  they  become outfile.out,
     outfile.rec, and outfile.map.

OPTIONS

     -mips16
	  
	  Compile using MIPS16 (TinyRISC) instructions.

     -v
	  
	  Be verbose. With this option switched on, pmcc displays the
	  command lines it uses to invoke the compiler, assembler, and
	  linker.

     -xflash
	  
	  Create a downloadable image that will copy itself into flash.
	  See also.

     -board boardname
	  
	  Create a standalone (non PMON) image that contains a board
	  support package for the specified board. To find out which
	  boards are supported by this command, invoke pmcc with 
	  "-board help".  See also.

     -ssyms
	  
          Place the symbols in a separate file  named  a.sym  (or
          outfile.sym).  This  is  useful  when debugging a PROM-
          based application.

     -syms
	  
          Do not include symbols  in  downloadable  output  file.
          Important  when  producing a download file for non PMON
          environments.

     -srec
	  
          Generate Motorola S3  records  instead  of  fast-format
          records.   Important when producing a download file for
          non PMON environments. Also required  when  downloading
          via a Terminal Emulator.

     -fast
	  
          Generate fast-format records  instead  of  Motorola  S3
          records.

     -crt0
	  
          don't link in a startup file (crt0.o or crt1.o).

     -prom
	  
          Concatinate the text and data sections in the  S-record
          file. Forces S-record generation.
	  See also.

     -double
	  
          Use LSI-supplied double-precision math library.

     -chksum
	  
          Don't include a checksum in  fast-format  records.  For
          compatibilty with earlier versions of PMON.

     -T adr
	  
          define the start address for the text section.

     -D adr
	  
          define the start address for the data and bss sections.

     -EL  
	  
	select little endian byte ordering.

     -EB  
	  
	select big endian byte ordering.

     -o name
	  
          define the output file name.

     -Dname[=value]
	  
          define a preprocessor constant.

     -L   
	  
	discard standard list of directories that are  searched
          for libraries.

     -Ldir
	  
          add dir to list of directories that  are  searched  for
          libraries.

     -I   
	  
	discard standard list of directories that are  searched
          for include files.

     -Idir
	  
          add dir to list of directories that  are  searched  for
          include files.

     -O[2-3]
	  
          select optimization level.

     -G N
          
	  control which global variables will be accessed via the
	  small data/bss section (using gp). All global variables
	  that are equal or smaller in size (measured in bytes) than
	  the value of N (default 8), will be placed in the small
	  data/bss section. Specifying "-G 0" determines that no
	  variables will be located in the small data/bss section,
	  and that the compiler will never use the gp-relative
	  address mode.

     -g   
	  
	generate information for source-level debuggers.

     -S   
	  
     	  stop after assembling.

     -c   
	  
	stop after compiling.

     -W[acl],arg1[,arg2...]
	  
          pass arguments directly to the assembler 'a',  compiler
          'c', or linker 'l'.

     -f-  
	  
	read extra arguments from stdin.

     -ffilename
	  
          read extra arguments from filename.

     -driver
	  
	  identify the S-record file as a SerialIce-1 driver.

     -mips2
	  
	  enable support for the MIPS2 instruction set.

     -lx
	  
	  search the -Ldir directory list for a file named libx.a.

     -float
	  
	  instruct the compiler to not promote float to double during
	  function calls. Not available on all toolsets.
