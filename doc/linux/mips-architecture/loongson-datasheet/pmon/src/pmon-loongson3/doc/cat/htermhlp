		Windows95 Using Hyperterminal

Setup

  »  Select "Start-Programs-Accessories-Hyperterminal"
  »  Double Click on "Hypertrm"
  »  Enter name eg. "direct1", then "OK"
  »  Set "Connect using:" to "Direct to Com1", then "OK"
	
	  »  Set "Bits per second:" to "9600"
	  »  Set "Data bits:" to "8"
	  »  Set "Parity:" to "None"
	  »  Set "Stop bits:" to "1"
	  »  Set "Flow control:" to "none"
	  »  Select "OK"
	

Now press reset on the Monitor board. If you
don't see a banner message from PMON/IMON you might need a special cable.

If you get dropped characters when displaying some commands (eg "r"),
you probably need to enable the 16550 buffer. Select
File-Properties-Configure-Advanced and make sure that the FIFO
buffers are enabled. Note that you must Disconnect and Connect the Call
before this change will take effect.

If the command-line editing characters ^A, ^B etc. don't work, change
Propeties-Settings to vt100.

Sending Files

To send a text file to the target, perform the following steps:

  »  PMON load
  »  Hyperterminal
	
	  »  Select "Transfer-Send Text File"
	  »  Use Browser to select directory
	  »  Set "Files of type:" to "All files"
	  »  Select the .rec file, then "Open"
