		The UNIX tip Command
		The UNIX tip Command

The UNIX tip command is a very simple terminal emulator. It does not
support scripting or specific terminal emulation, but it does provide
a mechanism to communicate with a target via an RS-232 link, and
permit files to be downloaded.

Setup

  »  Create the file ~/.tiprc containing:

	force=\377
	raisechar=\377

  »  Invoke tip and specify the I/O port.

	% tip -9600 device

where device is the I/O port that you wish to use in order to
communicate with the Target.

Unfortunately there isn't much standardization of device
names across different UNIX vendors, so you will probably have to ask
around a little in order to find out the names of the serial ports on
your system. Here are some values that I am aware of.

VendorPort names
Sun Microsystemsttya..ttyb..etc
Silicon Graphicsttyd1..ttyd2..etc

Sending Files

Normally everything you type is sent directly to the target. However,
if you start a line with '~' it is interpreted as a direct command for tip.
For example, to download a file you type:

	~ filename

That is, tilde, followed by '' followed by the name of the file
that you wish to download.

To obtain a complete list of the commands available type '~?'. 
tip also maintains a large number of variables that
control its operation. You may display the state of these variables
by typing '~s all'.
