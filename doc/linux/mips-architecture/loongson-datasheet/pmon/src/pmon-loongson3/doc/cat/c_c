The c Command
c

The c command makes program execution continue after a breakpoint has 
stopped program execution. 

Format

The format for the c command is:

c [-w][bptadr] 

where:

bptadrspecifies a single breakpoint. The breakpoint is removed 
when execution halts at this specified address.

-wDon't wait (imon and imon95 only).

Invoking the c command with no arguments causes the program execution 
to continue from the address specified in the epc register. 

Functional Description

When the user enters the c command, program execution starts at the 
address pointed to by the EPC register's current value. Use the g command 
to start program execution from an address specified on the command line.

As an option, a single temporary breakpoint
may be specified. The temporary breakpoint is removed when execution
halts. The temporary breakpoint is removed if another breakpoint stops
program execution first. 

Examples of the c command follow.

PMON c 		Continue execution until exit or a regular
			breakpoint is encountered.

PMON c a0020104	Continue execution until 0xa0020104 or a regular
			breakpoint is encountered.
