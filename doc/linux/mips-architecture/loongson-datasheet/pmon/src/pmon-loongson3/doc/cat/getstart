This package contains software to support three entirely different
techniques for testing and debugging target-resident programs.

PMON is a traditional debug environment
where the debug monitor runs on the same board as the application. The
advantage of this scheme is that you only need a single target board.  The disadvantage is that the
monitor consumes significant amounts of ROM and RAM space. It also makes the environment
that you application runs in, much different than the standalone
environment that it will eventually encounter once it has been "blown"
into ROM.

SerialICE-1A, on the other hand, requires
two separate boards, one for use as the Target, and the other for use as the SerialICE Controller. Its advantage is that it requires
minimal resources of ROM and RAM in the Target. It also runs the
application in an environment that much more closely resembles the
standalone environment that it will eventually encounter once it has
been "blown" into ROM.

SerialICE-1B, retains the benefits
of SerialICE-1A in requiring only minimal target resources, but
eliminates the need for the SerialICE Controller board. However, this
solution is presently only available for Windows 9x/NT hosts.

To build (or use) any of these programs you will need the
following hardware and software:

  »  A Host Computer System
  »  MIPS C compiler for your Host
  »  A debugger for your Host
  »  A Target board (and for SerialICE-1A a controller board)

Now make your choice of PMON, 
SerialICE-1A, or
SerialICE-1B, 
and proceed to the next step in the installation procedure.
