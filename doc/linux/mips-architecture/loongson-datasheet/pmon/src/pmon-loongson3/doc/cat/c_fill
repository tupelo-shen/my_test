The fill Command
fill

The fill command writes a hexadecimal pattern or string to a block of 
memory.

Format

The format for the fill command is:

fill from to {val|-s str}-

where:

from	is the base address for the fill operation.

to	is the end address for the fill operation.

val	is the hexadecimal value of the byte that is written to the area 
	to be filled.

-s str	specifies that the memory block should be filled with an 
ASCII string rather than a particular value. String str is the 
ASCII string to be written to the memory block during the fill 
operation if the -s parameter is specified.

Functional Description

The fill command fills an area of memory with a specified hexadecimal 
pattern or repeating string. The pattern can be a single byte or multiple 
bytes. For the fill command to work correctly, to must be greater than 
from. If the -s option is specified, the next parameter is interpreted as an 
ASCII string. Multiple-word strings may be specified by enclosing them 
in quotes.

For example, to clear an area of memory from 0xa0020000 to 0xa0021000, 
enter:

PMON fill a0020000 a0021000 0

To fill an area of memory from 0xa0020000 to 0xa00210000 with the 
string of values 0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44, and 0x45, enter:

PMON fill a0020000 a00210000 41 42 43 44 45 

To fill an area of memory from 0xa0020000 to 0xa00210000 with the 
ASCII string "hello world," enter:

PMON fill a0020000 a0021000 -s "hello world"
