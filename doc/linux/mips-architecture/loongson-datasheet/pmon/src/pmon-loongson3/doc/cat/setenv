		Setting your Environment
		Setting your Environment

In order to use the pmcc command (or any of the other commands in the
tools directory), you must set your environment correctly. How you do
this depends on the type of host you are using. Please refer to the
appropriate section below:

MSDOS Hosts

To set your environment, move to the directory where you unpacked the
PMON5 source archive and type,

	C setenv

(this assumes that you have already run the "Install" program).

The batch file SETENV.BAT creates a number of new environment variables
which often exceeds the available environment size. If this happens,
the operating system will usually respond with a message something like
"Out of Environment space". To fix this problem, add the following line
to your \CONFIG.SYS file:

	SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\ /E:1024 /p

Where C:\DOS is the directory that contains COMMAND.COM and
other MSDOS utilities. This expands your environment space
to 1024 bytes.

This is also the stage where you might discover that your path
variable is too long. Unfortunately the only indication is
usually that the operating system echoes the new path to the
screen. So if you see a list of directories printed to the
screen after you type SETENV, it likely means that you need to
shorten your path. Unfortunately the only way to do this is
shorten your directory names, and move things closer to the
root directory.

To set the environment back the way it was before, type,

	C unsetenv

This is especially useful if you have built more than one copy of PMON5,
each with different target parameters. You can then use the UNSETENV
command when moving from one package to another, since it is usually
very important to use the correct package when building a program.

UNIX Hosts

To set your environment, move to the directory where you unpacked the
PMON5 source archive and type,

	source.csh 		-- csh or tcsh
	dot.sh			-- sh or bash

csh and tcsh users should note that they might need to type 'rehash'
before the pmcc command is recognized.

Note also that this only sets the environment in the current shell. If
you decide to use a different window you will need to repeat this
procedure. On the other hand, if you have built  more than one copy of
PMON5, each with different target parameters, you must use a different
window for each package, and be certain to set the enviroment of each
window correctly before compiling any programs.

Note that you should not set the environment unnecessarily as it will
keep expanding your environment size and possibly cause you to run
out of space. The general rule is; If you get the message "Command
not found." (or something like that) after issuing the pmcc command,
you likely need to set your environment.
