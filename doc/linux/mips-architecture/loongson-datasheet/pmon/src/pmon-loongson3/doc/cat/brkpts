		How Breakpoints Work
		How Breakpoints Work

Breakpoints are set using the 
't', 
'to', 
'b', 
'g', 
'c', 
or 'when' commands.  
The 't', 'to', 'g', and 'c' commands set
temporary breakpoints that are automatically deleted when execution
halts. The 'b' and 'when' commands set persistent breakpoints that must
be explicitly deleted (using the 'db' command).

When the user types a 'b' command to set a breakpoint. The Monitor decides which type of breakpoint to utilize
using the following algorithm:

	if (is_writeable(addr)) bptype = RAM;
	else if (is_cacheable(addr) & cpu_has_ilock) bptype = ILOCK;
	else if (cpu_has_hwbp) bptype = HW;
	else error();

This information is saved in an array.  When execution is started, the
Monitor walks through the breakpoint array and implements the
breakpoints using the following rules:

RAM 
Replace the instruction at the specified address with a "break"
instruction and save the previous contents (the instruction) so that it
can be restored when execution halts. 

ILOCK 
Use the Icache locking feature to lock a "break" instruction into the
Icache at the specified address.

HW 
Program the hardware breakpoint register to generate an exception when
execution reaches the specified address.

When an exception is encountered, the MIPS processor
passes control to the General Exception Vector. The Monitor
then restores the previous contents of all breakpoints, and transfers
control to the prompt.

Thus, if the memory is inspected, the break instructions will never
be seen, as they are only present in memory during execution of the
application program.

The only exception to this is if the program hangs in such a way as to
require the user to press reset on the target system. In this case the
Monitor will "forget" that breakpoints had been set, and so you will
see any RAM breakpoints as break instructions in memory. At this point
the application program must be re-downloaded to obtain correct
execution.
