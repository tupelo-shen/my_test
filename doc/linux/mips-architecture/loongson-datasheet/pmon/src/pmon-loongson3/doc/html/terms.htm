<p>A terminal emulator can provide assembly-level debugging. It permits the user to
display/set registers and memory, and to single step and set breakpoints. In this mode you
can use global symbols, but you can't use local variable names. A Terminal Emulator is
often used to <a href="sendfile.htm">send a file</a> to the Target.</p>

<p>For more program-specific information, please select the appropriate program below.

<ul>
  <li><a href="htermhlp.htm">Hyperterminal</a> (Windows 95/98/NT) </li>
  <li><a href="xtalk.htm">Crosstalk</a> (MSDOS, Windows 3.x, Windows 95) </li>
  <li>Procomm (MSDOS, Windows 3.x, Windows 95) </li>
  <li><a href="tiphelp.htm">tip</a> (UNIX) </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the <a href="mondef.htm">Monitor</a> does not require any specific type of
Terminal Emulation, but vt100 is always a safe choice if you need to make one.</p>

<p>You should configure the terminal emulator on your Host for 9600 baud, 8 bits data, no
parity, 1 stop bit, and whatever communication port you chose on the back of your Host,
turn on the power to your SerialICE Controller/Target, and you should see a banner that
looks something like this:</p>
