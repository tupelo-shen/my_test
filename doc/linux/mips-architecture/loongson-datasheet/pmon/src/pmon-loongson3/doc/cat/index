	Host-resident Commands
	Host-resident Commands

These commands are built using the 
makefile and
your Host's 
native
C compiler. They are located on the tools directory and are required
in order to build anything using your MIPS C
compiler.

pmcc
	  
	This program can be used to invoke your cross compiler.
	It works just like the UNIX cc command but has the 
	advantage that
	it uses the correct include files, libraries, and start
	addresses for executing the program under PMON (or IMON).

dis
	  
	This program invokes the disassembler that was supplied
	with your cross compiler.

edown
	  
	This program can be used to download FastFormat or
	Motorola S-records to a target system running PMON.

tftp-put
	  
	This program can be used to download FastFormat or
	Motorola S-records to a target system using Ethernet.

prfp
	  
	Converts between floating-point and hex.

rdfrec
	  
	Read and disassemble a FastFormat file.

rdsrec
	  
	Read and disassemble a Motorola S-record file.

gencoff
	  
	Generate a COFF file from a binary file.

genfrec
	  
	Generate a FastFormat file from a MIPS ECOFF file.

gensrec
	  
	Generate a Motorola S-record file from a MIPS ECOFF file.
