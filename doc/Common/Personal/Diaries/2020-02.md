Today is my first day to record my diary in english. I hope that I can always write forever and I can level up my ability of writting in english.

I'm still quarantined by a new form of pneumonia which is caused by coronary virus in my rented room. I should be work from home about 8 hours, then read the books in which I have interesting, such as *Understanding Linux Kernal*, *Linux Device Driver 3th* and so on.

Today it's over!

Today I'm still quarantined by a new form of pneumonia which is caused by coronary virus in my rented room. I have worked from home about 8 hours, learning the usage of the Tokenizer for HART and the EDDL specification. Then I will read the book of *Understanding Linux Kernal*.

In addition, I registered the WeChat public account.
 
Good Luck!
