# uncle Craven

After a long sea journey, she was met in london by Mr Carven's housekeeper, Mrs Medlock.

Together they travelled north by train. Mrs Medlock was a large women, with a very red face and  bright blank eyes. Marry did not like her, but that was not suprising. Because she did not usually like people. Mrs Medlock did not like Marry either.

"What a disagreeable child." thought the housekeeper,"but perhaps I should talk to her."

"I can tell you a bit about your uncle if you like. " she said loud."He lives in a big old house , a long way from anywhere. There are nearly a hundred of rooms, but most of them are shut and locked. There was a big park around the house and all kinds of gardens. Well, what do you think of that?"

"Nothing." replied Marry, "It doesn't matter to me."

Mrs Medlock laughed, "you are a hard little girl. Well if you don't care, Mr Craven doesn't either. He never spents time on anyone. He's got a crooked back , you see , and although he's always rich, but he was never really happy until he married-"

"Married?" repeated Marry in surprise.

"yes, he married a sweat, pretty girl and he loved her deeply. So when she died-"

"oh, did she died?"  asked Marry, insterested.

"Yes,she did. And now he doesn't care about anybody. If he's at home, he stays in his room and sees anybody. So you must stay out of him away and do what you are told."

Marry stared out of the train window and gray sky and the rain.

The train journey lasted all day and it was dark, when they arrived at the stain.

Then there was a long drive to get the house. it was cold , windy night. And it was raining heavily. After a while,  Marry began to hear a strange, wild noise.

she looked out of the window, but couldn't see nothing except the darkness.

"what's that noise?" She asked Mrs Medlock."it's not the sea, isn't it?"

"no, that's the moor. it's the sound the wind makes, blowing across the moor."

"what is moor?"

"It is just miles and miles of wild land, with no trees or houses. your uncle's house is right on the edge of the moor."

Marry listened to the stange, frightening sound. "I don't like it." she thought, " I don't like it."

she looked more disagreeble than ever.
