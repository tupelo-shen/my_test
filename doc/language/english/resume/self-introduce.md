## 1 self-introduce

Thank you, the interviewers. Thank you for spending time on interviewing me. My name is Wanjiang Shen, 34 years old. I was born in Shandong Provence. I got a bachelor degree in physics when I graduated from Yantai university in July 2010. Then, I got a master degree in microelectronics when I have graduated from Tianjin university in January,2013. 

Because I like programming in embedded software, so I studied some courses related to computer science, such as the principles of computer, the C programming language, the C++ programming language, the usage of uC/OS and linux,and so on.

And so far, I have more than 8-year experiences in embedded software development. 

## 2 First job

After graduation, 

1. I joined with a company which provided with some communication equipments and controllers used underground coal mine.

2. In this company, I was a software engineer, and responsible for building embedded software based on uC/OS-II and linux os.

3. Where, l learned about some industry standards such as IEC-61508 for industrial safety, some industrial field bus, such as Hart, RS485, CAN-bus, MODBUS, ProfiNet-bus, Ethernet/IP, some software design principles for a system applied into industry, particularly the safety of life are vital for industrial fields.

4. And my skills in C/C++, Linux/uC-OS environment have a high improvement.

## 3 Second job

My first job was ended in June, 2016. Because I wanted to learn about much more knowledge in Programming. So I left tianjin for Beijing and joined into the R&D center of Yokogawa(Beijing) that is a Japanese corporation. 

In this company, 

1. I was still a software engineer. But besides coding, I was responsible for decomposing requirements from japanese headquarter and completing detailed design documents based on this; 

2. I will communicate with Japanese headquarter in japanese. Sometimes, I worked with engineers from Rockwell, but communicated with only in E-mail.

3. I was reponsible for completing the design of medium scale platform based on iTRON-OS, and providing support for the application development based on this platform.

4. In addition, I was responsible for the design of C++ framework based on this platform, including customized C library, customized C++ STL library and customized widgets, dialogs, buttons and so on.

where, I learned about communication skill with engineers of different cultures, software design pattern, waterfall development process, and test automation(like programming python or ruby scripts based on selenium for testing the embedded web applications).

## 4 Third job

Next, April 2020, I left YOKOGAWA for Hollysys until now. It is a company that provides with process autumation equipments and solutions. At here, I have a oppotunity for building a operating system from scratch. 

In this company, 

1. I worked as a project manager and system engineer. I am responsible for software architecture design and coding of the embedded OS based on micro-seL4. Now this OS has running on the Loongson's chip based on MIPS architecture, which implements task management, memory allocation, semaphore, mutex, message queue, file system, tcp/ip stack and POSIX-compatible APIs. And based on this os, we have developed a distributed control system.

2. As a PM of Embedded OS project, I'm responsible for task assignments and communications among members.

3. Besides these, I am also responsible for building the edge computing controller based on Xen virtualization technology on X86 and ARM architecture.

At here, I learned about how to make a team work more effectively as a leader. And I have got a deeper understanding of the operating system.

These are my working experience after graduation. It's over.

## 5 Edge Computing controller

I am responsible for building the edge computing controller based on Xen virtualization technology for X86 and ARM architecture.

## 6 Embedded OS based on microkernel-seL4

1. I am responsible for software architecture design and coding of the embedded OS based on micro-seL4. 

2. I'm project manager of Embedded OS project, responsible for task asssignments and communications among members.

## 7 4-wires liquid analyzer

1. This project is mainly to provide high precision liquid analyzer for petrochemical enterprises, waterworks, or scientific research institutes, which is used to analyze the content of various liquid components and provide precise and reliable data for customers to make decisions.

2. The project is divided into housing module and sensor modules (digital or analog). The housing module is responsible for HMI, file recording, error diary recording, sensor module settings, calibration, etc. The sensor module is responsible for data collection, calculation and diagnosis of its own health. The HART protocol is used to communicate between the housing module and the digital sensor, and the modbus protocol is used to communicate between the housing module and the analog sensor.

3. Development platform and language: 

    - hardware platform - Renesas RX700 (Cortex-M3 core) and PIC16-bit MCU;
    - software development platform - Linux environment, rewritten the C/C++ basic library, IDE-Eclipse;
    - Operating system: Itron OS.

## 8 WinCE application translate into Linux platform

1. Transplanting the system from the WCE platform to the Linux platform to meet the new market demand;
2. Hardware platform - main control board based on TI's M3352 (Cortex-A9) chip;
3. Software platform -Linux;Language -C/shell;Debugging tool - GDB.

## 9 Electrohydraulic control system

1. The project is mainly developed for underground automatic coal mining, replacing the original manual operation;The system is composed of several subsystems, which are used to provide the shearer with space and control the shearer to automatically and efficiently extract coal.
2. System composition:
(1) Monitor computer, which is responsible for the action state information feedback of the entire electro-hydraulic control system, the integration of video images, and the control of the following subsystems;
(2) the whole working face is composed of 100 to 200 stents controller, each controller is independent control system, also can with any communication between a controller and control, each controller with independent keyboard, you can also use the remote control for motion control, and support through all kinds of sensors pressure, stroke, attitude to condition monitoring and control;
(3) use the program stick to update each submodule program, monitor the host to remotely update the functions of the following subsystem programs online.
3, Hardware platform - monitoring host (Cortex-A9), scaffold controller (Cortex-M4), wireless infrared transceiver (Cortex-M3 + CC1101), solenoid valve driver (Cortex-M3), HUB (Cortex-M3);

## 10 Why did you leave your last job / Why are you looking for a new job?

I leave my last job for looking for a more open situation which will use more of my skills and experience. And recently, I have beginning to study english, so i really want to join a foreign business for improving my english skill. In addition, I want to find a new job for which I can work for a long time.

## 11 Why do you want to work here

Lexmark has a leading position in printer industry. I think I can get more oppotunities and impovements if I work here. And my experience and skills in the embedded software stack can also help bring value to the company.
