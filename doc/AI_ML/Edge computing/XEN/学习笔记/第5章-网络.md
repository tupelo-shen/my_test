So you’ve got your nice, shiny Xen box all set up and running, and now you want it to talk to the outside world. This seems eminently reasonable. After all, Xen’s primary use is server consolidation—and a non-networked server is a contradiction in terms. Well, you’re in luck. Xen has a robust and well-tested network foundation, which is versatile and easy to set up.

Like much of the rest of Xen, the networking infrastructure reuses as many standard tools as possible. In this case, Xen uses the standard bridge utilities and the ip command[^1] all glued together with some clever bash and Python scripts to handle traffic between the dom0 and domU network interfaces.

As an administrator, your primary interaction with Xen virtual net devices is through the various config files. As you might expect, global parameters and initial setup are mostly handled by directives in xend-config.sxp. Domainspecific configuration is done within the domain’s config file.

More advanced configuration can be done by modifying Xen’s network scripts, stored in /etc/xen/scripts.

[^1]: The IP command `/sbin/ip` is the modern (unfortunately named) replacement for ifconfig. Get it as part of the `iproute2` tool set, which offers similar functionality to `net-tools` but with added features.
